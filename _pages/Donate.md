I believe in freedom of information, but if you feel like donating to me feel free. 

I speak from experience in my articles and so they are not your typical bs articles you find on popular search engines that lack any amount of genuinity. 

I only accept crypto as this is apart of my philosophy democracy - power to the people which is what I view crypto currency as. 

Please only give what you can absolutely afford.
