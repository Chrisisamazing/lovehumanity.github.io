The secret with prayer is to have the genuine intention of helping the person/thing you are praying and doing it for them and not for yourself. To progress towards God, it’s important to serve your fellow man, meditate and pray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When praying for others, you draw towards you Gods’ helpers/guides/angels etc. who will help you with your needs and help you to progress towards God. So, helping others through service and prayer is almost definitely in everyone’s best interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technique that I use to pray nowadays is to sit and visualize the person/thing that is causing harm to the world and send out a prayer that this person/thing is helped by God but doing so in a manner without any ill intent towards the person/thing you are praying for but doing so in the genuine intention that this person is helped by God for his benefit and not your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another technique which has helped me along my journey, and I think which will help others is to use Jesus’s prayer which is a really good prayer called the “Lords prayer” which you can find a copy of it somewhere on the internet, but it goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our Father who art in heaven,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hallowed by thy name,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thy Kingdom come,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thy will be done,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On earth as it is in heaven,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give us this day our daily bread,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lead us not into temptation,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But deliver us from evil,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the Power and the Glory is yours, now and forever and ever,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amen”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, I say this prayer a few times (but leave the amen until the end) and say it with conviction and trueness in your heart. Over time you will be able to take up regular prayer and draw towards you Gods angels/guides who will work alongside you to help for your benefit and the benefit of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to also give my article a read which is similar to this one &lt;a href=&quot;https://lovehumanity.gitlab.io/spiritual/Pray-For-Your-Enemies/&quot;&gt;Pray for your Enemies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 1: 24/02/22&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also made my own prayer if anyone is interested in my prayer feel fre to use it as a template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Said with conviction and sincerity and a belief in the power of God and with an understanding and trueness in the meanings of the words. Be sincere and actually act like you art thanking God directly when saying this prayer for the ‘magic’ to work. Generally I repeat this prayer for half an hour and it will and has done wonders for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our Father who art in heaven,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hallowed be your name,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thank you for all the blessings that you send to us on earth,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For helping those in need,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping us away from evil and helping those who are seduced by evil,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leading us not into temptation,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But leading us to become more Christ like,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing peace and harmony to the world,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving us the strength, fortitude and courage to fulfill your will for each of us,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helping us to serve you,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helping those will ill will in their hearts to step into the light,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helping those who don’t believe in your power,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And giving us freedom and leading us to you,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amen”&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">Praying is one of the things that I think a lot of people can benefit from.

&lt;p&gt;Right intention begins by becoming more mindful of your intentions and so I believe that right mindfulness is linked heavily to right intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me I oft take my own interpretation in Buddhism which is why I enjoy it so much because it’s very flexible and I don’t think it’s a religion but more of a way of living. To me right intention is about bringing others up/helping people in some way because I recognize that all is one and so to hurt/harm anything is harming yourself. It’s also about not letting yourself down and doing things which are in your best interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also about meaning because meaning comes from helping others and serving others and not just thinking for yourself as I myself have found out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me I have been very selfish with regard to things and avoided others a lot and it has made me very alone in life which has contributed heavily to my own downfall in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But seek to practice right intention in your life because life should be about helping others to the best of your ability and for me God sees everyone’s struggles and understands how difficult it can be for people, but my advice would be to persevere and see it through and just have faith in God that he will get you through rough times because faifth is what gives us strength.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right intention is also about not giving way to thoughts of ill will or harming others (which for me has been a hindrance in my life and is one of the five hindrances) because your own thoughts are very important in defining who you are and what your actions are. Therefore, if you know that you give way to unwholesome thoughts seek refuge in prayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, don’t just read these words blindly and practice here what I have said today because you are able to change yourself through these very wise words and thereby change the world for the betterment of mankind and when you help others and work for others then by the law of mutual attraction which I have an article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://lovehumanity.gitlab.io/spiritual/The-Law-of-Mutual-Attraction/&quot;&gt;The Law Mutual Attraction&lt;/a&gt; you will attract towards you people/guides/angels who will work with you to help you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><category term="Buddhism" /><summary type="html">Now I believe that right intention is one of the more important parts of the eightfold path because if you don’t have right intention then all else fails in terms of freeing yourself from suffering.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Sloth and Torpor</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/buddhism/Sloth-and-Torpor/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sloth and Torpor" /><published>2022-02-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-02-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/spiritual/buddhism/Sloth-and-Torpor</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/buddhism/Sloth-and-Torpor/">&lt;p&gt;Sloth and Torpor is described as an unwholesome state whereby the mind is dulled, and it leads one into a thick and irritable depression. It is one of the 5 hindrances in Buddhism and is I think quite a significant hindrance for following the path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have suffered tremendously from Sloth and Torpor and yet I still amaze myself at the accomplishments in life that I have still been able to make, even with being under Sloth and Torpor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess the reason why I have suffered and given way to Sloth and Torpor is due to me having an attachment to incarnation because we progress a lot quicker while incarnate and I just really want to progress towards God and as this blog proves (to myself) I have made considerable progress towards God. I guess my attachment towards progress towards God has caused me tremendous amounts of suffering in my life and its something I need to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional approach to dealing with Sloth and Torpor is to contemplate death more and spend time understanding death because Buddhism sees that Sloth and Torpor is mostly caused by your relationship with death and attachment to death. The sad thing is – is that there is a heaven and life goes on and everyone has their own journey in life they go on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you just give up on things and don’t enjoy life as much as you would like to because you are so focussed on death that you miss the present moment and don’t live your life how you would like to and just don’t actually live life and it caused me more suffering than anyone could ever know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I realize that like if I were to die it would free me and I would become the person I was always destined to be. But that isn’t to say I actually want to die because it doesn’t achieve anything. I guess it really plays into this notion of what I think death actually is. I just envision it as nothingness which is a strong delusion and a delusion, I have been under for too long now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I haven’t entirely been truthful towards myself because there is something which has caused this state of Sloth and Torpor which I don’t actually recall, which is really unfortunate for me because I find myself in a state of Sloth and Torpor and it is related to this traumatic event in my life which was so traumatic, I don’t actually recall it and I am seeking help with this.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><category term="Buddhism" /><summary type="html">Sloth and Torpor is described as an unwholesome state whereby the mind is dulled, and it leads one into a thick and irritable depression.

I will talk a little about meditation and give you my basic technique which I have used for a few years now, which I have got from the Great White Brotherhood. If you would like to know why meditation is so important feel free to read The Great White Brotherhood’s article on the subject, in short you become a more devleoped human being - you develop your auras and allow your chakras to open up more and allow energy to pass more freely into them, you are also able to develop the gifts of the spirit over many years. The gifts of the spirit are telepathy, telekenesis, clairvoyance, clairsentience and teleportation. But you shouldn’t meditate with the goal of devloping the gifts - meditate with the intent on meditating and over time the gifts will appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly when you start meditating its best to choose a quiet place where you can not be disturbed by others and where there is little outside noise and distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly you should say a short prayer thanking God for his protection and thanking Angels and your guides for watching over you as you meditate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly you should visualise yourself using your hands placing a cacoon over yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you do these things then you should sit quietly ideally in a chair or a place of your choosing and then try to clear yourself of your thoughts as best as you can for about 15 minutes. Consistency is key with anything in life as with meditation, so you shouldn’t over exert yourself and spend longer in meditation than you need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you have finished 15 minutes of meditation, then you should send this energy which you have received from God out to the world - just imagine yourself sending out this energy is all you need do. Then thank Gods angels and your guides for watching over you and then imagine yourself lowering this cacoon that you had placed over you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aim to make meditation apart of your daily routine and you can meditate for longer and as frequnetly as you wish, but aim to be consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spirutal journey should be trod carefully and in good time. Most of the time people who are on their spiritual journey feel that they are doing God a disservice when they take a break from spirutality and spirutal work. But they should recognize that it is of their own choosing and God has patience with all his subjects because all roads lead to rome (so to speak). So don’t feel that you are doing God an injustice when you take a break from spirutality because the path should be trod as and when one chooses, but also in good time, so don’t feel the need to constantly push yourself to practice spirituality and let Gods angels guide you to be able to take a break from spirutality in a way that isn’t detrimental to your wellbeing, your mental health and your physical health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also when you take a break from spirutality you shouldn’t feel guilty about doing so and you should let your guides and your angels know of your decision to take a break from spirutality and it is of course your right to do so and you shouldn’t feel that you are letting God down in doing so because God gives all his subjects the right to tread the path as and when they choose, but also lets his subjects choose themselves as and when they should take a break from spirutality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">I will outline why its so important to take a break from spirutality, especially in times when you feel you have had enough.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Law of Mutual Attraction</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/The-Law-of-Mutual-Attraction/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Law of Mutual Attraction" /><published>2022-02-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-02-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/spiritual/The-Law-of-Mutual-Attraction</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/The-Law-of-Mutual-Attraction/">&lt;p&gt;The Law of Mutual Attraction is a univerisal law which quite simply means that like attracts like. A basic example is your own thoughts that you put out to the world you receive in return, so if you are having lots of negative thoughts, then the world will respond to that by attracting you to people of a similar nature in terms of people whom think like you, whereas if you are more positive, then the world will seem like a much brighter and better place. I feel we need more people in the world who are more optimistic about their circumstances and people whom are positive in nature and have good attitudes towards things because what you put out to the world - you receive in return. Feel free to also give my article on why giving to others is of vital importance &lt;a href=&quot;https://lovehumanity.gitlab.io/spiritual/Giving-To-Others/&quot;&gt;Giving To Others&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays the Law of Mutual Attraction is well known from places like YouTube Twitter etc, but that doesn’t take away the truth from this universal law. So the world will pick up on your own thoughts and send you back what you put in so to speak. But this law doesn’t just apply for your thoughts - it applies to everything in your life the people that you see in your life are a result of this universal Law of Mutual Attraction, when you change yourself you will be drawn to people who are similar to you in terms of the changes that you’ve made to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way its similar to karma - what goes around comes around. What you put out to the world is what you receive in return. I used to sulk all the time, because of something personal then the world will send me things to sulk about. But its not the way to go about getting what you want in life ever. People should strive to be loving to one another, strive to be happy and let go of the past, which I feel is a source of a lot of hurt for most people.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">The Law of Mutual Attraction is a univerisal law which quite simply means that like attracts like.

I myself have allowed pride to affect me a lot and its cost me a lot in life as it has others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone has the ability to give and it’s important that others give because as the Master Jesus once said you ‘reap what you sow’, therefore what you put out to the world you will also get in return, but only if you believe that God will return what you give and you shouldn’t worry too much about when you God will return what you give because so long as you have enough faith that God will give what you put out – he will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its important also to not have ill will when giving to others but have the real intention of helping them and doing it for them and not for yourself, and having trust that God will return to you in his own time whatever it is you give out to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A basic example is when you pray for others with the intent of helping them, then God will see that and will return that and help you in some way. But it all comes down to right intention (working for the good of others) in Buddhism which is something I have struggled with a lot in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also a really good video on YouTube that said that giving to others will make you a lot happier and a lot more cheerful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78nsxRxbf4w&quot;&gt;Ted Talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is information which I got from The Great White Brotherhood’s book “Linking with the 4th dimension” Chapter 27 The Giving Plane, you can find a link to the book here &lt;a href=&quot;https://thegreatwhitebrotherhood.org/books/&quot;&gt;Linking with the 4th Dimension&lt;/a&gt; and I have found it to be true in my life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">You should first start by recognizing that it’s not all about you and allowing things like pride and arrogance (ego) have an impact on your ability to give.

&lt;p&gt;I guess the reason I do that is because I desire something and don’t yet fully appreciate that all desire and wants will inevitably lead to suffering and it’s as the saying goes you can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wrongly have this belief that I need to please others and be a good person all the time, which is just wrong because I don’t need to be a good person if I chose not to be and this doesn’t make me a bad person, because what makes a good person? It’s relative what makes a good person and should be your own interpretation of what it means to be a good person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you shouldn’t take it in extremes because it can be too much of a good thing which is a form of evil, it’s also about desire because you desire to be a good person and this leads to suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution is of course to strive for balance in things and never take things too personally and never take things to extremes because you can commit sins in taking things to extremes i.e thou shall not kill and its just also unfair on the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">Sometimes I take things to extremes and it has caused me and others a lot of suffering.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Too Much Of A Good Thing</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Too-Much-Of-A-Good-Thing/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Too Much Of A Good Thing" /><published>2022-02-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-02-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Too-Much-Of-A-Good-Thing</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Too-Much-Of-A-Good-Thing/">&lt;p&gt;Recently I realized that I was praying and asking for too much and it was being given to me, but it was a bit off because it was too much of a good thing and there is such thing as praying for too many good things because the prayers that I sent out were essentially competing with one another when they should have been working with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution I feel to not having too much of a good thing is only take that which you can handle. Don’t feel you are letting others down in rejecting their good things they sent to you because you can have too much of a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also about slowing down because with me being in dark for so long and suddenly being in the light I realized that like I was just having so many good things as a means of compensating for being in dark for so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My general advice would be to realize when you are having too much of a good thing and so slow down when you feel you’re having too much of a good thing and also to not be greedy in the good things that you have, but express gratitude for all the good things that are coming your way and the good things that you already have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that I’ve put a lot of posts on my blog, but the reason I put these all in a massive batch like this is due to me being in a mental hospital and having a lot more time to better understand myself and thereby make considerable progress towards God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it’s about taking your time and don’t feel you need to rush because of others, because when you rush the whole world rushes because you make up the world. So, take your time and remember that the journey is a marathon not a sprint so enjoys each and every moment of it.&lt;/p&gt;

But if I’m being completely honest, you should aim to do good in your own home first before you go around trying to do good elsewhere – you should seek to fix the issues in your own home before trying to fix issues in other people’s home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I’ve suffered a lot and that suffering has really made me into the person that I am today, but I put efforts to see the good in what that suffering has brought to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also realized that I sometimes can’t do good in the world because I can be selfish sometimes, but in such times, I realized that I compensate that by doing good someplace else, which isn’t a bad thing at all. But deters me from actually changing myself when I do this because I think its ok for me to ‘give up’ when I have done good elsewhere in the world. But it doesn’t make it alright.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also realized that this is a really good principal to live by that if you can’t do good in your own home, seek to do good elsewhere in the world because you are not the only person in the world and it’s important that you stay true to yourself and your own beliefs in things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I just wanted to add that you should have good intentions when following this simple principal. By good intentions I mean serving God, helping others etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good that you can seek to do is endless, offer your service as a volunteer in some way, donate some money to charity, give your money to a friend in need, phone a friend you haven’t spoken to in some time. Point being is that when you can’t do good in your own home for some reason, seek to do good elsewhere in the world because it will be the world a much better place for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you should also strive for balance in what you put out to the world and don’t take things to extremes and seek to recognize when enough giving is enough. Feel free to also read my article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://lovehumanity.gitlab.io/spiritual/Giving-To-Others/&quot;&gt;Giving&lt;/a&gt; which explains why its of vital importance that everyone gives to others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">In this short post I will talk a little about how when you can’t do good because of some reason like a disagreement with yourself or a flaw you have that you should do good elsewhere.
