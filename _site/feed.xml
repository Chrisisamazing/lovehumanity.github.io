&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I think have been causing me to not do as well as I could be doing is due to virtue signaling. I tend to think that God is watching and so will do things that I think that God would want me to do and not things that I think are right in my heart. So I would essentially do things in attempts to impress God, which is very wrong to do because I am not being very real and authentic with myself. I guess its foolish to do such things because God doesn’t need his subjects to do any such virtue signaling to him or to anyone else for that matter. But God wants all his subjects to be very real with themselves. In terms of doing what they think is right/wrong. But the worst part about it all is that I was very unaware of when I was virtue signaling, I wasn’t very mindful of my own thoughts and actions and mindful of my own intentions, but I guess that the main reason that I did virtue signaling is because I was being boastful towards myself and kinda just hurting myself because I knew that virtue signaling brought dirtiness/death towards the soul because impressing others and God via virtue signaling is wrong and that you don’t even realize when you are virtue signaling and you then allign your actions with what will bring death to the soul, which is not fair or kind on yourself. The reason that I did this is because I knew that it was dirty to do something like this and brought death to the soul, because I didn’t see myself as an individual of the earth. I didn’t see that like I myself was a person to other people and ignored the positive effects that I have had on the world, which is a means of putting myself down. I had no respect for myself because I kept putting myself down because I wrongly believed that it was the right thing to do, I mainly did it out of worry of being hurt and going through more suffering in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose that the greatest irony about this article is the fact that I still give way to virtue signaling towards God, which is very wrong, but its a flaw that I would like to work on and hopefully remove fully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related to this is I feel like the relationship with myself could be a lot better. I feel that everyone should seek to develop a kind and loving relationship with themselves and who they truely are and also be true to themselves, and not do things to impress others but just be themselves, I guesss like related to that is that you shouldn’t seek to give into others expectations of you and not give into who others want you to be in life and not conform to what others want you to believe. But you should hold true to your own morals and beliefs and not worry about the damage that it may cause to others and the world. I also realized that its actually really evil to put someone down especially yourself and others around you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also felt that other people were better than me in some way and didn’t see them as people, but didn’t see myself as my own person standing on my own two feet and taking action in terms of what I truely believe is right and wrong. But you know one thing I really have learned on my journey which I think is really important is to believe in yourself and your own abilities, but also to believe in others. 
God would also like all his subjects to have absolute faifth in him and God would reward those of whom are faifthful to him and punish those who are harming Gods kingdom by hurting themselves and others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">I thought I would write a short peice on virtue signaling.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Taking the Saw Dust out of Your own Eyes</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Taking-The-Saw-Dust-Out-Of-Your-Own-Eyes/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Taking the Saw Dust out of Your own Eyes" /><published>2022-01-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-01-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Taking-The-Saw-Dust-Out-Of-Your-Own-Eyes</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Taking-The-Saw-Dust-Out-Of-Your-Own-Eyes/">&lt;p&gt;I realized that I haven’t been very truthful and honest and sincere towards myself and one of the reasons was because of ignorance, but also arrogance - I feel like the arrogance that I have towards myself and not practicing right intention which is 1 of the eight foldpaths were betraying me and letting me down so much in my life and I feel like I should learn to practice the eightfold path a lot more as I feel like it will bring a lot of peace and harmony to me in my life right now and feel like I should learn to tap into my feelings a lot more in terms of how I really feel deep down and learn that feelings are good things to have and are not in any way a weakness and that you shouldn’t repress your feelings because of others and what they believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been betraying myself and what I truely stand for. I’ve just been acting like a fool the entire time and I should learn to forgive myself for all that I’ve put myself through and learn to practice right intention and to practice mindfullness and to not give into arrogance or pride, but to show myself some respect and dignity for who I am truely. But I just wanted to make this quick blog about how important it is to before you go around putting efforts into helping other people, you first put efforts into helping yourself. As the very wise and great master Jesus put it once “You should take the sawdust out of your eyes”. Or as I like to put it you should put your gasmask on before you put the gasmask onto others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus also understood that you shouldn’t like go around teaching others things that they don’t wish to understand or as he put it do not throw your pearls before pigs, lest they trample them underfoot and turn to attack you. But this is also true of yourself, you shouldn’t put efforts to change too quickly too fast because otherwise you could damage yourself and also you should be willing to learn new things. Jesus also understood that you shouldn’t go around boating to others about your spiritual advances because you yourself are far from perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its also about seeing things more clearly, because generally I find a lot of people live in their own worlds and no two people live in the same world and so everyone has their own reality to which they conform to and so sometimes people will live in alterantive realities which are delluding them from the truth and causing them considerable harm to themselves which isn’t good. I find that something I haven’t really been practicing is good intentions and I haven’t been very kind to myself because I guess in part because I was afraid of what people may think of me, which is very unkind towards myself because why should I care what others think of me, more than I care about what I think of myself, because its related to others in terms of because there are others that have opinions I care about what they think of me or may think of me.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">I realized that I haven’t been very truthful and honest and sincere towards myself and one of the reasons was because of ignorance, but also arrogance - I feel like the arrogance that I have towards myself and not practicing right intention which is 1 of the eight foldpaths were betraying me and letting me down so much in my life and I feel like I should learn to practice the eightfold path a lot more as I feel like it will bring a lot of peace and harmony to me in my life right now and feel like I should learn to tap into my feelings a lot more in terms of how I really feel deep down and learn that feelings are good things to have and are not in any way a weakness and that you shouldn’t repress your feelings because of others and what they believe.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Evil</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Evil/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Evil" /><published>2021-12-31T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-31T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Evil</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Evil/">&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, I will say here that evil is a very seductive power. You need to be an advanced being I believe to not be seduced by evil. But what most people who give way to this evil don’t actually realize is that evil is controlling their actions significantly more than they are controlling their own actions. I will also say that evil generally has this very red kind of energy that consumes the person and clouds their ability to see reality clearly because they are so consumed by this evil which in turn makes them very ignorant, arrogant, and selfish towards the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to say that nothing good can be achieved by giving way to evil. The only thing that evil brings is suffering to yourself and suffering to others through destruction. I also want to add that being so evil it removes any amount of sincerity that you may have had, evil also I feel brings out the more negative aspects which make us human for example arrogance, ignorance, neglect etc. I find that I can be very ignorant when I chose to be, which is quite selfish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, when you give way to evil so much you thereby block more of the positive aspects to yourself such as the ability to feel more positive things, such as joy, happiness, love, sincerity because evil has so much power over you. You become someone you were never supposed to be. What is worse is that most evil people don’t recognize that evil has so much power over them which is limiting the power of God and limiting their positive emotions, they wrongly believe that they have control over evil and that evil gives them power. The power of God is a lot more powerful than the power of evil, but you need to open yourself up more to the power of God by reducing the very things that evil seeks to promote like pride, arrogance, ignorance, selfishness etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power of evil also attempts to undermine things that you think about yourself. Such as your own worth to the world, it seeks to put you in a corner and casts judgements upon you on the kind of person that you should be, it seeks to turn you into a fool, it seeks to make you doubt yourself, it seeks to make you experience mental suffering, emotional suffering, physical suffering. But what is worse is that those who use evil, will become so seduced by its power that the evil will actually turn on them and destroy them and their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also just wanted to add quickly is that when you are so influenced by evil you may notice what is known as throught block, which is where the power of evil actually is so powerful it prevents the thought coming through to your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, you should seek to pray to God each day that he keeps you from evil. Only the power of God keeps the power of evil away, nothing else can prevent the power of evil. If you yourself are able to see that you are being influenced by evil in someway pray to God that you reduce the power that evil has over, you and pray that you reduce the temptation it has over you. If you recognize that others are being influenced to do evil, seek to pray for them so that you can increase the power of God in the world and help to reduce the evil in the world and the suffering that’s in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">First and foremost, I will say here that evil is a very seductive power.

I’ve suffered immensely because of all the judging that I have given to myself, all the times I felt like I’m unworthy or inadequate because of all the judging that I have caused myself. Its also caused me a lot of suffering thinking about how others will judge me or view me and I guess its mostly because of all the judging that I have given to myself and so I think that everyone else judges me the same way that I judge myself. But I realized that giving judgment to someone (including yourself) isn’t correct because of all this suffering that judging inflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I argue that to judge someone is actually a form of evil because of the suffering that it is likely to cause and it causes people to believe that they are constantly being judged by others which causes them a lot of suffering. In light of this, I feel its very important to put efforts to reduce the judgment you give yourself and the judgment that you give to others because of all the suffering that it is likely to cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important point that the Buddha made when he was on earth (which I got from this awesome book Why Buddhism is True by Robert Wright) was that the less you judge things – including the contents of your mind – the more clearly you’ll see them, and the less deluded you’ll be. In judging, you are essentially implying that your way of seeing things is the correct way of seeing things and is the correct reality – when that is not the case. But I think what the Buddha was saying was that the less judging you are to things, the more in line with reality you will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, judging myself or worrying how others will judge me has caused me a lot of suffering in my life and I realize now that you shouldn’t judge yourself or worry how others will judge you. Put efforts to if others judge you in some way not allow there judgment of you to cause you suffering. Let God be the judge of those that judge others. Its also important to not seek vengeance on those that caste judgment to you, but its also important to show those that have been judged by others unfairly compassion, understating etc. Then its also important to show those that have judged others forgiveness in what they do because I feel like the people that judge others a lot don’t quite realize the suffering that they are causing to others and you know the reason that people judge others is because on some level they themselves feel like they are being judged in some way.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">I wanted to make this short post today on judging others and yourself.

The answer to overcoming these issues that hinder me so much is so become like a child again as Jesus described it. What this really means is that you become more accepting of things that you may otherwise disagree with and put efforts in reducing things like your arrogance, pride, ego, ignorance etc because as a child you realize that you don’t know it all and so are more willing to accept different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I also realized is that my cup was full, in terms of all the things that I had incorporated as part of me, arrogance, pride, choosing to be ignorant etc. This meant that I wasn’t as easily willing to accept certain things; I.e things that may be beneficial for me, but would hurt my pride and so not being like a child hindered my spiritual progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I made the analogy that everyone has their own cup of water which represents all the things that make up who they are and what they incorporate into themselves. Generally most people’s cups are full and so they already have a lot of things incorporated into them, but its unfortunate that most of those things are things that hinder progress, I.e arrogance, pride, ego, ignorance, evil etc. Therefore, its important to put efforts to emptying your cup so to speak so that you can remove all these things that are hindering your progress and so that you can become more like a child again so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my personal experience, I already was aware of Jesus saying you should become like a child again to progress towards God, but never fully grasped its significance until I had first hand experience at how much my own ways were hindering my progress and realizing that the only way to overcome these things was to accept that I don’t know it all and become more like a child (or put efforts to become more like a child). In doing this it allows me to open myself more to new possibilities and empty my cup of water some more to that I can remove it of these things that were hindering my progress and add better, more holier things in my cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, its very important to become more like a child again so that you can further progress towards God and progress in spirituality. In putting efforts to become more like a child again it will allow you to empty your cup more and allow you to more easily remove things like arrogance, ignorance, pride, selfishness, evil etc. I also realized that growth in spirituality is very much just a process of becoming less ignorant of the reality of things. I also want to add here that you can put efforts to become more like a child at any age, even if you are elderly – its never too late to make progress in spirituality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">I realized recently that perhaps one of the biggest hindrances to my growth is my own arrogance, ego, ignorance, pride and evilness (which I intend to make a separate blog post about).

&lt;p&gt;Journaling is something which I picked up about 2 years ago and has been an amazing resource for me to analyze myself daily. In my view analyzing yourself is an important aspect of following the spiritual life because it forces you to recognize more of your bad habits/behaviors that you have and so allows you to think over how you can improve yourself because without analyzing yourself daily you will not be able to identify your faults/flaws that you have and so will hinder your progress. Therefore journaling is an important thing for you help to improve yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a garden and I will often times of an evening go out and journal about my day which I find quite therapeutic to write about my day in my journal, because I think its important for each person to feel understood and journaling is a means to achieve that. It also gives some time for me to reflect on my day and explore areas in myself that need improvement and what I can do to improve myself. The main reason I didn’t start a diary/journal sooner was because I had a fear that my enemies/relatives would read it and use it to my own disadvantage, but I later realized that I should go ahead with it because there is more to be gained from it than potential disadvantage it brings me if someone reads it and to be honest I want my journals to be like a testament for my life so that I can be better understood in my actions and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally the format of how I write in my journal is the following; First make an entry with date:time then write about what I did that day/ past few days, how I feel about those things and then write about anything else that comes to my mind and then I will end the entry with a direction/goal of what I think will help me to improve and become better and where I want to be headed. Generally this format has really helped me and journaling in itself has given me a massive opportunity to really consider the direction I want to go in with various things which has benefited me massively. I feel like a lot of people are lost these days in things such as social media and they really don’t know in which direction they go – with journaling it gives an opportunity to really consider and understand yourself and figure out which direction you want to take in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have also been many great people who used journaling as well as I have some notable people that kept their own journals are; Charles Darwin, Thomas Edison, Leonardo da Vinci, Benjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein, Thomas Jefferson, Nikola Tesla, Lewis Carroll, John Adams, Emma Watson and many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude this short post; you should keep a journal for its therapeutic benefit, the improvement it will bring to you spiritually through analyzing yourself, the improvement it will bring to you emotionally because it will help you to become more mindful of your feelings and thoughts that you have and so will allow you to overcome negative feelings and thoughts that you may have towards things. I have also laid out my general format for filling my journals which I hope will bring some benefit towards you in thinking about how to format your journals. Great people have also understood the importance of journaling and so I encourage all who read this to take up journaling and begin to analyze yourself daily through writing in your journal and it will allow you to improve yourself and become better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><category term="Wellbeing" /><summary type="html">In this very short post I will talk about the importance of journaling.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">People’s Expectations of You</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/peoples-expectations-of-you/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="People’s Expectations of You" /><published>2021-10-08T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-10-08T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/spiritual/peoples-expectations-of-you</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/peoples-expectations-of-you/">&lt;p&gt;In this short post I will talk a little about other people’s expectations of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not meeting other people’s expectations of me has caused me a lot of pain and suffering and its actually only recently I realized that its not the other person’s expectations I’m not meeting but its what I think there expectations are of me and not meeting them which causes me that pain and suffering. There is a subtle difference. I make an assumption on what others expect of me and when I feel I haven’t or don’t meet that expectation then it causes me great pain and suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But  I realized that you can’t be a slave to other people’s expectations for you, because how free are    you really if you limit yourself to what other people expect of you and try to always follow other people’s expectations? People often have a view – a  label or a box to put you in so that they can better understand how to behave around you, but their view/label of you isn’t reality. You should focus on yourself and leave people to have their opinions and expectations and views of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry if you haven’t or don’t meet the expectations of others. What gives their expectations of you higher priority than your own expectations of yourself? Also just know that you will never be able to meet everyone’s expectations for you. One person may expect you to be x while other people expect you to be Y and Z, so therefore you shouldn’t aim to meet expectations of others. As in meeting other people’s expectations that they have of you shouldn’t be the end goal. In fact I argue that you shouldn’t even concern yourself with the expectations others have of you because like I said you should only care about the expectations that you have of yourself. But even then I would advise to have low expectations for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, don’t make following the expectations that others have of you be the goal because it limits the freedom you have to be the person that you want to be and not the person that others want you to be. A good analogy of this is; a tree can be perfect for the bird that uses it as a nest, or it can be perfect for the person cutting the tree down for the raw material, or it can be perfect for the apples it produces, or even perfect for the shade that it provides people, but a tree doesn’t strive to be perfect according to other people’s wants/needs – a tree strives to be perfect according to what it perceives as perfect. Applying this to expectations people have of you is that everyone will have different expectations of you, but you shouldn’t concern yourself with those expectations that they have and should strive to meet your own expectations and be perfect according to yourself and being the person that you want to be - not the person that other people want you to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will just end by saying that the only person’s expectations who you should be trying to meet are your own expectations of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">In this short post I will talk a little about other people’s expectations of you.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Pray for your enemies</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Pray-For-Your-Enemies/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Pray for your enemies" /><published>2021-10-04T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-10-04T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Pray-For-Your-Enemies</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Pray-For-Your-Enemies/">&lt;p&gt;In this short article I will look at the importance of praying for your enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me first start by saying that there are always two forces at place in life. The forces that work for good and the forces that work for bad or evil. Now the forces that work for bad or evil are the forces that we should pray for because they have succumb to evil and are actively working to bring harm and mayhem throughout the world, these are people that hold positions of power as these positions allows them to harm as many people as possible, so these evil people hold positions as bankers, politicians, religious leaders, trade unionists, business leaders, people that work in Government such as civil servants, education leaders etc. It is our job as good people to send the power of God to these people through the act of prayer. I also wanted to just note that those who are not spirtualy awake generally tend to work for the forces of evil as they are asleep in a spiritual sense. You either work for the forces of evil, or you work for the forces of good in the world. There is no in-between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technique that I use to pray for bad/evil people is to visualize the harm they are causing the world and pray to God in simple language or express the prayer via thought for them to be helped for their benefit and for the world’s benefit. There are no ill thoughts when praying for bad/evil people because to do so would act for the forces of evil. When we pray for them we do so for their benefit and for the world’s benefit. If by result of pray they lose their power and are seen for who they truely are then so be it. Short term ramifications for them may be seen as bad by them and they may despise you for some time, but it would be for their own benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to share the story of the Bible of David and Goliath and the hidden meaning behind this story because it relates to this. This interpretation is taken from the book the stairway to freedom. The story goes that two armies oppose each other on a battlefield, the Philistines are the bad guys, while the Israelites are the good guys. The Philistines have a giant on their side called Goliath who terrifies the Israelites. So the king of Israel asks a shepherd named David to help the situation. David puts a stone in his sling and throws it at Goliath, the stone finds a chink in Goliath’s Armour and kills him. The Israelites are then victorious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Philistines are actually the people around us that try to destroy our happiness and peace in order to profit for themselves such as bankers, politicians, business leaders, religious leaders etc and so Goliath is the embodiment of those bad vibrations within these kinds of people. The Israelites represent all ordinary good hearted people. In the story the king od Israel is actually God. David represents you and me - just ordinary people. So David speaks to the King Saul (this means that we meditate and pray to connect with God). Through prayer and meditation we are given the arm, the power of God. The stone that David projects towards Goliath implies that we pray for our enemies and through that act we direct the mighty force for good which is God towards those who would harm reducing the evil people’s power to harm us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of David and Goliath simply means that through our connection with God, we are able to, by the act of prayer and meditation and service to our fellow man render powerless those evil people that would harm us. In doing this we work to reduce the evil in the world and help to make the world a better place, more beautiful place. It was the aim of Jesus to bring light into the world and to make the world a better place and so it should be the aim of everyone that reads this to make the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, its important that each and every one of us begins to pray for our world leaders, the bankers, the politicians, the business leaders, the religious leaders, trade union leaders etc. So that we can reduce their evil on the world and help to bring about a better world for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">In this short article I will look at the importance of praying for your enemies.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Positive Thinking</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/wellbeing/Positive-Thinking/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Positive Thinking" /><published>2021-09-26T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-09-26T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/wellbeing/Positive-Thinking</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/wellbeing/Positive-Thinking/">&lt;p&gt;In this short post I will look at the importance and value of positive thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positive thinking is the practice whereby you seek and actively go out of your way to see the positive in things, but more importantly is that you don’t dwell on the negative side of things and try to be as positive as you can about life in general. This is especially important when life has you down, because there is little use in being down and dwelling so much on the negatives, you should focus more on the positive aspects. Its a skill that is learned and is a skill that I have recently started to pick up, but have not yet mastered, so take what I say as just someone who is still learning how to be positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With positive thinking is pushes you to not give into negative thinking and encourages you to change your beliefs on things that cause you to be in a negative state. It also forces you have a healthier outlook on life. Being postie all the time makes you become a happier person because with looking for the positives you appreciate and accept that its not all so bad and that there are good things in life. Becoming a happier person is 100% beneficial towards you and allows you to better deal with problems, because being unhappy and negative you are more likely to struggle with problems and so give up on a problem more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being positive is closely linked to gratitude, but is different in that with gratitude you are appreciating what you already have, being positive is changing your outlook to a more positive one. You should seek to practice both being positive and gratitude. Please refer to my article on &lt;a href=&quot;/wellbeing/spiritual/Gratitude/&quot;&gt;gratitude&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life brings many challenges to everyone, some challenges are harder than others and you may make mistakes from time to time, but see them for what they are mistakes, because you can’t change your past mistakes, but you can change your outlook towards them now. Seek to change your outlook on your past mistakes and you will become a happier person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key thing with being positive is that you don’t focus so much about the negative side of things, but trying to be positive in your outlook towards things. A basic example of changing your outlook may be that you couldn’t meet with some friends on a weekend, but the positive was that it gave you more time to work on an assignment and you focus on this rather than dwelling on the fact that you were unable to meet with your friends. Another basic example is you failed in an exam, having failed it now gives you an accurate perception of your gaps in knowledge and so is a positive because it allows you to study more on those gaps in your knowledge so that you can become better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will leave on a pleasant talk by a Buddist monk who gave a talk being positive link is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goo2IMA-nBw&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Wellbeing" /><summary type="html">In this short post I will look at the importance and value of positive thinking.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Practice Spirituality in Secret</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Practice-Spirtuality-in-secret/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Practice Spirituality in Secret" /><published>2021-09-25T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-09-25T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Practice-Spirtuality-in-secret</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Practice-Spirtuality-in-secret/">&lt;p&gt;In this short post I will give some reasons and justifications why those on the spiritual path should do so in secret and not announce it to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first reason why the path should be done so in secret is because generally people dislike someone standing in the light because they are immersed within the grand illusion of this world and so seeing someone in the light threatens the reality into which they conform to and so they will use whatever means they have at their disposal to hurt and discredit you. Therefore, the advice that is generally given to those on the path to freedom is to do so in secret in quiet and peace. Jesus said a similar thing and told people whom he brought light to to not tell anyone. For example in the sermon on the mount Jesus said “Do not give dogs what is holy, and do not throw your peals before pigs, lest they trample them underfoot and turn to attack you”. What he was suggesting was to not throw pearls of wisdom to those of whom are not ready for it because otherwise they may turn and attack you and hurt you. But for those following the path I would recommend you study what Jesus taught because he was a spiritual master and was and is on the path towards God, his sermon on the mount and the 10 commandments are a good starting point for studying Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason why the spiritual path should be trod on in secret is because the focus should be on following the spiritual path in seriousness and sincerity, not promoting and boasting to others of your achievements and doing it for the “fame” reasons, because this will deter you from actually following spiritual path. Let others have their opinions and judgments of you and carry on following the path in secret and leave them to have their judgments of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly the final reason why you should follow the spiritual path in secret is because the spiritual journey that you go in is personal to you. Everyone has a different journey that they go on, no one two people go on the same journey. What you found changed you for your benefit, may change another person and have the same impact as another person. Therefore you should follow the spiritual path as you can in peace and quiet. Jesus himself even said that you should pray in secret to God, give to charity in secret so that “fame” reasons don’t deter you from actually following the path, because some people follow the path and give to charity so that they may be seen and to have credit towards them. Don’t let this apply to you. Follow Jesus’s teachings and pray in secret and give to charity what you can afford in secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note the general advice is to share your knowledge of the spiritual path to only those of whom are seekers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
