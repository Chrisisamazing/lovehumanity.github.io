If you would like to know why meditation is so important feel free to read The Great White Brotherhood’s article on the subject, in short you become a more devleoped human being - you develop your auras and allow your chakras to open up more and allow energy to pass more freely into them, you are also able to develop the gifts of the spirit over many years. The gifts of the spirit are telepathy, telekenesis, clairvoyance, clairsentience and teleportation. But you shouldn’t meditate with the goal of devloping the gifts - meditate with the intent on meditating and over time the gifts will appear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly when you start meditating its best to choose a quiet place where you can not be disturbed by others and where there is little outside noise and distractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly you should say a short prayer thanking God for his protection and thanking Angels and your guides for watching over you as you meditate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly you should visualise yourself using your hands placing a cacoon over yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you do these things then you should sit quietly ideally in a chair or a place of your choosing and then try to clear yourself of your thoughts as best as you can for about 15 minutes. Consistency is key with anything in life as with meditation, so you shouldn’t over exert yourself and spend longer in meditation than you need to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you have finished 15 minutes of meditation, then you should send this energy which you have received from God out to the world - just imagine yourself sending out this energy is all you need do. Then thank Gods angels and your guides for watching over you and then imagine yourself lowering this cacoon that you had placed over you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aim to make meditation apart of your daily routine and you can meditate for longer and as frequnetly as you wish, but aim to be consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The spirutal journey should be trod carefully and in good time. Most of the time people who are on their spiritual journey feel that they are doing God a disservice when they take a break from spirutality and spirutal work. But they should recognize that it is of their own choosing and God has patience with all his subjects because all roads lead to rome (so to speak). So don’t feel that you are doing God an injustice when you take a break from spirutality because the path should be trod as and when one chooses, but also in good time, so don’t feel the need to constantly push yourself to practice spirituality and let Gods angels guide you to be able to take a break from spirutality in a way that isn’t detrimental to your wellbeing, your mental health and your physical health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also when you take a break from spirutality you shouldn’t feel guilty about doing so and you should let your guides and your angels know of your decision to take a break from spirutality and it is of course your right to do so and you shouldn’t feel that you are letting God down in doing so because God gives all his subjects the right to tread the path as and when they choose, but also lets his subjects choose themselves as and when they should take a break from spirutality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">I will outline why its so important to take a break from spirutality, especially in times when you feel you have had enough.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Law of Mutual Attraction</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/The-Law-of-Mutual-Attraction/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Law of Mutual Attraction" /><published>2022-02-16T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-02-16T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/spiritual/The-Law-of-Mutual-Attraction</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/The-Law-of-Mutual-Attraction/">&lt;p&gt;The Law of Mutual Attraction is a univerisal law which quite simply means that like attracts like. A basic example is your own thoughts that you put out to the world you receive in return, so if you are having lots of negative thoughts, then the world will respond to that by attracting you to people of a similar nature in terms of people whom think like you, whereas if you are more positive, then the world will seem like a much brighter and better place. I feel we need more people in the world who are more optimistic about their circumstances and people whom are positive in nature and have good attitudes towards things because what you put out to the world - you receive in return. Feel free to also give my article on why giving to others is of vital importance &lt;a href=&quot;https://lovehumanity.gitlab.io/spiritual/Giving-To-Others/&quot;&gt;Giving To Others&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays the Law of Mutual Attraction is well known from places like YouTube Twitter etc, but that doesn’t take away the truth from this universal law. So the world will pick up on your own thoughts and send you back what you put in so to speak. But this law doesn’t just apply for your thoughts - it applies to everything in your life the people that you see in your life are a result of this universal Law of Mutual Attraction, when you change yourself you will be drawn to people who are similar to you in terms of the changes that you’ve made to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a way its similar to karma - what goes around comes around. What you put out to the world is what you receive in return. I used to sulk all the time, because of something personal then the world will send me things to sulk about. But its not the way to go about getting what you want in life ever. People should strive to be loving to one another, strive to be happy and let go of the past, which I feel is a source of a lot of hurt for most people.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">The Law of Mutual Attraction is a univerisal law which quite simply means that like attracts like.

&lt;p&gt;You should first start by recognizing that its not all about you and allowing things like pride and arrogance (ego) have an impact on your ability to give. I myself have allowed pride to affect me a lot and its cost me a lot in life as it has others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone has the ability to give and its important that others give because as the Master Jesus once said you ‘reap what you sow’, therefore what you put out to the world you will also get in return, but only if you believe that God will return what you give and you shouldn’t worry too much about when you God will return what you give because so long as you have enough faifth that God will give what you put out – he will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A basic example is when you pray for others with the intent of helping them, then God will see that and will return that and help you in some way. But it all comes down to right intention (working for the good of others) in Buddhism which is something I have struggled with a lot in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also a really good video on Youtube that said that giving to others will make you a lot happier and a lot more cheerful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78nsxRxbf4w&quot;&gt;Ted Talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is information which I got from The Great White Brotherhood’s book “Linking with the 4th dimension” Chapter 27 The Giving Plane, you can find a link to the book here &lt;a href=&quot;https://thegreatwhitebrotherhood.org/books/&quot;&gt;Linking with the 4th Dimension&lt;/a&gt; and I have found it to be true in my life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">In this short post I will talk a little bit about why giving to others is so important in life.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Taking Things To Extremes</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Taking-Things-To-Extremes/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Taking Things To Extremes" /><published>2022-02-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-02-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Taking-Things-To-Extremes</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Taking-Things-To-Extremes/">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I take things to extremes and it has caused me and others a lot of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess the reason I do that is because I desire something and don’t yet fully appreciate that all desire and wants will inevitably lead to suffering and it’s as the saying goes you can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wrongly have this belief that I need to please others and be a good person all the time, which is just wrong because I don’t need to be a good person if I chose not to be and this doesn’t make me a bad person, because what makes a good person? It’s relative what makes a good person and should be your own interpretation of what it means to be a good person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you shouldn’t take it in extremes because it can be too much of a good thing which is a form of evil, it’s also about desire because you desire to be a good person and this leads to suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution is of course to strive for balance in things and never take things too personally and never take things to extremes because you can commit sins in taking things to extremes i.e thou shall not kill and its just also unfair on the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">Sometimes I take things to extremes and it has caused me and others a lot of suffering.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Too Much Of A Good Thing</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Too-Much-Of-A-Good-Thing/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Too Much Of A Good Thing" /><published>2022-02-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-02-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Too-Much-Of-A-Good-Thing</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Too-Much-Of-A-Good-Thing/">&lt;p&gt;Recently I realized that I was praying and asking for too much and it was being given to me, but it was a bit off because it was too much of a good thing and there is such thing as praying for too many good things because the prayers that I sent out were essentially competing with one another when they should have been working with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution I feel to not having too much of a good thing is only take that which you can handle. Don’t feel you are letting others down in rejecting their good things they sent to you because you can have too much of a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also about slowing down because with me being in dark for so long and suddenly being in the light I realized that like I was just having so many good things as a means of compensating for being in dark for so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My general advice would be to realize when you are having too much of a good thing and so slow down when you feel your having too much of a good thing and also to not be greedy in the good things that you have, but express gratitude for all the good things that are coming your way and the good things that you already have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that I’ve put a lot of posts on my blog,, but the reason I put these all in a massive batch like this is due to me being in a mental hospital and having a lot more time to better understand myself and thereby make considerable progress towards God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it’s about taking your time and don’t feel you need to rush because of others, because when you rush the whole world rushes because you make up the world. So take your time and remember that the journey is a marathon not a sprint so enjoy each and every moment of it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">Recently I realized that I was praying and asking for too much and it was being given to me, but it was a bit off because it was too much of a good thing and there is such thing as praying for too many good things because the prayers that I sent out were essentially competing with one another when they should have been working with each other.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">When You Can’t Do Good In Your Own Home, Do Good Elsewhere</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/When-You-Cant-Do-Good-Do-Good-Elsewhere/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="When You Can’t Do Good In Your Own Home, Do Good Elsewhere" /><published>2022-02-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-02-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/spiritual/When-You-Cant-Do-Good-Do-Good-Elsewhere</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/When-You-Cant-Do-Good-Do-Good-Elsewhere/">&lt;p&gt;In this short post I will talk a little about how when you can’t do good because of some reason like a disagreement with yourself or a flaw you have that you should do good elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I’ve suffered a lot and that suffering has really made me into the person that I am today, but I put efforts to see the good in what that suffering has brought to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also realized that I sometimes can’t do good in the world because I can be selfish sometimes, but in such times I realized that I compensate that by doing good some place else, which isn’t a bad thing at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also realized that this is a really good prinicipal to live by that if you can’t do good in your own home, seek to do good elsewhere in the world because you are not the only person in the world and it’s important that you stay true to yourself and your own beliefs in things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I just wanted to add that you should have good intentions when following this simple principal. By good intentions I mean serving God, helping others etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good that you can seek to do is endless, offer your service as a volunteer in someway, donate some money to charity, give your money to a friend in need, phone a friend you haven’t spoken to in some time. Point being is that when you can’t do good in your own home for some reason, seek to do good elsewhere in the world because it will be the world a much better place for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you should also strive for balance in what you put out to the world and don’t take things to extremes and seek to recognize when enough giving is enough. Feel free to also read my article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://lovehumanity.gitlab.io/spiritual/Giving-To-Others/&quot;&gt;Giving&lt;/a&gt; which explains why its of vital importance that everyone gives to others.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">In this short post I will talk a little about how when you can’t do good because of some reason like a disagreement with yourself or a flaw you have that you should do good elsewhere.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Self-Importance</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Self-Importance/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Self-Importance" /><published>2022-02-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-02-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Self-Importance</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Self-Importance/">&lt;p&gt;I realize that I can be incredibly foolish, silly and ignorant sometimes My own sense of self-importance has let me down considerably and to think that I know better than others and God is foolish to think that way because God is in complete control of absolutely everything. People shouldn’t think they are better than others because of their perceived spiritual blessings they have received as a result of their faifth in God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve let myself and the world down considerably due to thinking that I’m more important than others which is wrong because everyone and everything is equal even God himself in the eyes of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I foolishly chose self-importance over others and I was too arrogant and blinded by ignorance and prideful to see what it was I was doing to myself. All those times I hurt and deceived people and lied to their faces when they said “are you ok”? And not being as honest as I should be to them and saying “yeam i’m fine” when I just wasn’t. But also not being true to myself and my own beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my own self-importance got in the way significantly in terms of making real tangeable progress towards God and I have been a complete and utter fool towards myself and let others down which isn’t what I stand for. But I have let others down and more importantly I’ve let myself down and the life of progress towards God which I would like to lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will continue to pray and meditate as best as I can each day to God in the hopes that I can change for the benefit of the human species and more importantly for the benefit of myself. Its wrong what I’ve done to myself and zeaoulsly evil to have done all the things that I’ve done to myself and to think I can get away with it is stupid and foolish and to think that others can’t see my own actions is fooling myself. Praying that I reduce my pride (which I have done now) and reduce my own sense of importance. But I feel the pace of spirtuality is far too fast and should slow down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own sense of self-importance isn’t who I want to be anymore in terms of how I identify with being very important. I should respect myself and others more to recognize that I have been given life and so should put efforts into doing God’s work and not the work of the devil/evil. I’m sorry towards myself for having done the things that I have done to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess its also about how I was in darkness for so long and now I’m begginging to see the light considerably more I wandered why I was in darkness for so so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of God should be in creating beautfy, lifting people’s spirits especially people who are down, expressing christ like emotions to others and more importantly yourself, striving to be happy, striving to be joyful, giving to others especially because the power of giving is true in the sense that what you give to others you get in return in the sense that you reap what you sow, but you should give with the belief that God will return to you what you give to others, but you shouldn’t to so for yourself – you should do so with the intent of serving God. Practing self-love more and being more positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I gave way to so much self-importance is due to me not recognizeing the oneness of all life and realizing that I’m not the only person in the world and its also incredibly selfish to not believe in the word of God.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">I realize that I can be incredibly foolish, silly and ignorant sometimes My own sense of self-importance has let me down considerably and to think that I know better than others and God is foolish to think that way because God is in complete control of absolutely everything.

&lt;p&gt;I guess the reason that I haven’t spoken to many woman in my life is due to my relationship with myself mainly, but also due to lack of courage and self-confidence and also that like I feel it will bring me more suffering because I for some reason feel its better that you are ‘stronger’ if you are alone and have no partner in your life because then you won’t suffer the loss of them. Which I now see is quite foolish of me because love between two people should be a wonderful thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like with the pandemic some people are feeling incredibly sexually frustrated because of how lockdowns are making it harder and harder to meet and greet new people and things like bars and restaurants are becoming more descriminated against because you need to show vaccine certrficates and tack and trace depending on where you are in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I feel like if you meet a certain partner who you can relate to and enjoy then you should bond and have a realtionship, rather than being seperated because you will feel a lot happier together and won’t feel as llost as most people who are single feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also feel a deep sense of lacking within yourself as you feel your heart mourne for someone else and company with another. Sometimes you can express your sexual frustation through dream sleep, but its important to not beat yourself up too much about having sex with people through dreams sleep because its a natural and healthy thing for people to do, but just seek to not break one of the ten commandments thu shall not commit adultery because its wrong to have sex with family members even if it is through dream sleep because its unfair and unhealthy because it is harmful to family life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technique to meet your new partner which I read from The Great White Brotherhood’s book the stairway to freedom (and a link to their website and free books are in my about page) is to sit quietely and tell God that you are ready to receive your perfect partner and thank him for sneidng you your perfect partner. It may take a number of weeks/months/years even to mee this person, but God’s angels will ensure that you two meet each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to add that you need to be willing to change with regard to meeting your perfet partner because a lot of people have flaws which will undermine the wonderful and beautfiul relationship that they wish to have together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also not beat yourself too much in the ways that you express your sexual frustation, there is no shame in how you express it. But seek to channel your sexual frustation into desire to change that sexual frustation and find a woman/man in your life, seek to goto places like parks, to bars, to nightclubs, to restaruatns, to socieities, weddings etc and just seek to put yourself out there is my general advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly I just wanted to add that I really lack affection a lot and have suffered tremendously from a lack of affection and that is mainly due to feeling the need to be ‘strong’ and is due to toxic masculinity which I feel our society doesn’t address enough because I still suffer from a lack of affection towards others and struggle to receive a lack of affection.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">This one is a touchy subject for me because I have experienced considerable sexual frustration and has mainfested itself in very peculiar ways, and much of which i’m not very proud of.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Suffering and the Four Noble Truths</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/buddhism/Suffering-and-the-four-noble-truths/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Suffering and the Four Noble Truths" /><published>2022-02-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-02-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/spiritual/buddhism/Suffering-and-the-four-noble-truths</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/buddhism/Suffering-and-the-four-noble-truths/">&lt;p&gt;In this artcile I will talk about suffering. Which for me is a subject mattar that I have struggled with a lot, in terms of how to deal with suffering and how to resolve suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will first say that I have suffered tremendously as a result of demonic possession, I have experienced considerable mental suffering as a result of being possessed when I was 17 because the demonic personality is still there, but it has somewhat lessened a lot due to not being tempted to use its personality which is still there. I will also just add that I was exercised with help from The Great White Brotherhood, which you can find a link in the about page of my blog to their website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also foolishly believed that the means out of suffering was to give way to evil, but it defintelety wasn’t because I just suffered a great deal more and it has cost me more than anyone could ever know. I don’t think that anyone should resolve their problems by giving way to evil or give way to evil for that mattar – feel free to check out my article on evil that I wrote which may help you with your own evil &lt;a href=&quot;https://lovehumanity.gitlab.io/spiritual/Evil/&quot;&gt;https://lovehumanity.gitlab.io/spiritual/Evil/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furhtermore I also realized that I make myself suffer in the present moment through like mental suffering, emotional suffering, making others suffer in the hopes of preventing further suffering, which is just not the means out of suffering. I guess it was mainly due to a total lack of courage in terms of worrying too much for the future and thinking that other people have more power over me. But you should know that you have complete autotomy over yourself whether you belive it or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Buddhism the means out of suffering is to follow the four noble truths and to meditate on them as it is wisdom from a very wise master the Buddha. Practicing the eightfold path is indeed the path out of suffering, but for me I struggle with understanding why that is and should really meditate and spend more time contemplating why it is the noble eightfold path is the means out of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first noble truth is that life is inheriently suffering, in life we suffer through things like physical suffering, mental suffering, emotional suffering and it is an inevitability that everyone will suffer in some way in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second noble truth is that change is a constant thing in life, and there is no stopping change suffering has a cause and we try to manipulate sitations, people and try to get our way. But the important thing to remember about the second noble truth is that disastification arises within us. Its you that are disasstified with the current position of the fact that you are going to suffer and that no mattar what you do life is inherientely suffering&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third noble truth which is perhaps the hardest one to grasp is that the cause of suffering is desire and attachment to things or disasstification as the Buddha describes it, because for me I realize that I have a lot of wants and also somewhat realize that not everyone can have what they want in life which is a universal truth and I guess I just need to be more accepting of this fact. Then I realize that I take it out on myself somewhat when I can’t have what I want because of my own arrognace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth noble truth is the promise that you can end your suffering and the suffering of others by teaching the noble four truths through ahering to the noble eightfold path. Which is right understanding, right intentions, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right concentration, right mindfulness. I won’t go into too much detail but this is the means out of suffering. Which I am still putting efforts to recognize.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><category term="Buddhism" /><summary type="html">In this artcile I will talk about suffering.
