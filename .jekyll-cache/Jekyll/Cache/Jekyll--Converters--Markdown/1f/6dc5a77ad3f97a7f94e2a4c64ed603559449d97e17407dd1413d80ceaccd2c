<p>Recently I realized that I was praying and asking for far far too much and it was being given to me. But it was a bit off because it was too much of a good thing and there is such a thing as praying for too many good things because the prayers that I sent out were sessentially competing with one another, when it doesn’t really mattar if a prayer is competing with one another because they all get answered in due time.</p>

<p>The solution I feel to not having too much of a good thing is only take that which you can handle. Don’t feel you are letting others down in rejecting good things that are sent through prayer because you can indeed have too much of a good thing which can and will be determinetal to your wellbeing and mental health.</p>

<p>It’s also about slowing down because with me being in the dark for so long and suddenly seeing the light I realized that like I was just having so many good things as a means of compensating for being in the dark for so long, and its incredibly selfish and not fair on yourself.</p>

<p>My general advice would be to realize when you are having too much of a good thing</p>
