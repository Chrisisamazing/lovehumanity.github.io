&lt;p&gt;Positive thinking is the practice whereby you seek and actively go out of your way to see the positive in things, but more importantly is that you don’t dwell on the negative side of things and try to be as positive as you can about life in general. This is especially important when life has you down, because there is little use in being down and dwelling so much on the negatives, you should focus more on the positive aspects. Its a skill that is learned and is a skill that I have recently started to pick up, but have not yet mastered, so take what I say as just someone who is still learning how to be positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With positive thinking is pushes you to not give into negative thinking and encourages you to change your beliefs on things that cause you to be in a negative state. It also forces you have a healthier outlook on life. Being postie all the time makes you become a happier person because with looking for the positives you appreciate and accept that its not all so bad and that there are good things in life. Becoming a happier person is 100% beneficial towards you and allows you to better deal with problems, because being unhappy and negative you are more likely to struggle with problems and so give up on a problem more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being positive is closely linked to gratitude, but is different in that with gratitude you are appreciating what you already have, being positive is changing your outlook to a more positive one. You should seek to practice both being positive and gratitude. Please refer to my article on &lt;a href=&quot;/wellbeing/spiritual/Gratitude/&quot;&gt;gratitude&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life brings many challenges to everyone, some challenges are harder than others and you may make mistakes from time to time, but see them for what they are mistakes, because you can’t change your past mistakes, but you can change your outlook towards them now. Seek to change your outlook on your past mistakes and you will become a happier person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key thing with being positive is that you don’t focus so much about the negative side of things, but trying to be positive in your outlook towards things. A basic example of changing your outlook may be that you couldn’t meet with some friends on a weekend, but the positive was that it gave you more time to work on an assignment and you focus on this rather than dwelling on the fact that you were unable to meet with your friends. Another basic example is you failed in an exam, having failed it now gives you an accurate perception of your gaps in knowledge and so is a positive because it allows you to study more on those gaps in your knowledge so that you can become better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will leave on a pleasant talk by a Buddist monk who gave a talk being positive link is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goo2IMA-nBw&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name><email>chrisisamazing@protonmail.com</email></author><category term="Wellbeing" /><summary type="html">In this short post I will look at the importance and value of positive thinking.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Practice Spirituality in Secret</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Practice-Spirtuality-in-secret/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Practice Spirituality in Secret" /><published>2021-09-25T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-09-25T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Practice-Spirtuality-in-secret</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Practice-Spirtuality-in-secret/">&lt;p&gt;In this short post I will give some reasons and justifications why those on the spiritual path should do so in secret and not announce it to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first reason why the path should be done so in secret is because generally people dislike someone standing in the light because they are immersed within the grand illusion of this world and so seeing someone in the light threatens the reality into which they conform to and so they will use whatever means they have at their disposal to hurt and discredit you. Therefore, the advice that is generally given to those on the path to freedom is to do so in secret in quiet and peace. Jesus said a similar thing and told people whom he brought light to to not tell anyone. For example in the sermon on the mount Jesus said “Do not give dogs what is holy, and do not throw your peals before pigs, lest they trample them underfoot and turn to attack you”. What he was suggesting was to not throw pearls of wisdom to those of whom are not ready for it because otherwise they may turn and attack you and hurt you. But for those following the path I would recommend you study what Jesus taught because he was a spiritual master and was and is on the path towards God, his sermon on the mount and the 10 commandments are a good starting point for studying Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason why the spiritual path should be trod on in secret is because the focus should be on following the spiritual path in seriousness and sincerity, not promoting and boasting to others of your achievements and doing it for the “fame” reasons, because this will deter you from actually following spiritual path. Let others have their opinions and judgments of you and carry on following the path in secret and leave them to have their judgments of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly the final reason why you should follow the spiritual path in secret is because the spiritual journey that you go in is personal to you. Everyone has a different journey that they go on, no one two people go on the same journey. What you found changed you for your benefit, may change another person and have the same impact as another person. Therefore you should follow the spiritual path as you can in peace and quiet. Jesus himself even said that you should pray in secret to God, give to charity in secret so that “fame” reasons don’t deter you from actually following the path, because some people follow the path and give to charity so that they may be seen and to have credit towards them. Don’t let this apply to you. Follow Jesus’s teachings and pray in secret and give to charity what you can afford in secret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note the general advice is to share your knowledge of the spiritual path to only those of whom are seekers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I will outline some things which I think are quite important in showing respect and love to God and his kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that I think is quite important in showing respect and love to God and his kingdom is to show kindness, understanding, forgiveness, love, compassion, and respect to all of Gods creation regardless of who or what they are. This could be paying respect to a flower by providing it water, this could be forgiving someone that did wrong by you. It could also be paying respect to the planet by recycling your bottles and tins etc. This also applies to yourself because whether you like it or not you are apart of Gods kingdom, therefore treat yourself with the same amount of love and respect as you would God. Everything and everyone have a place in Gods eyes and everything and everyone is equal according to God. Who are you to say otherwise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing that is quite important to showing love and respect to God and his kingdom is to not give way to dark, evil, bad thoughts because you may hide such thoughts from your colleagues and family, but you will not be able to hide such thoughts from God. Also related to this is to not give way to unhappiness and misery because you are blessed with the life that God has given you and so should strive to be happy and cheerful as a show of thanks towards God for the life that he has given you, because he could have chosen to not create you but he did out of pure selflessness, the least you can do is to show thanks by striving to be as happy, joyful and cheerful as you can possibly be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prayer and meditation is another thing which is important for paying respect to God and his kingdom because through meditation and prayer you can begin to build a relationship with God and also lessen the effects of ego which is dispositions and thoughts related to yourself, in other words thinking for yourself and not for others. Which is important to realize that it’s not all about you – there are other people in your life that are affected by your actions. Related to this is providing some kind of service to humanity, this could be through your job, through writing blog posts to spread your knowledge to the world, this could be helping your parents with household work etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly another means of showing love and respect towards God and his kingdom is by having faith that God will regardless of the circumstance provide for you, and this is something that I have personally struggled with because its difficult having faith that God will provide when things really are bad, in that it requires a lot of faith in God to go through hardship and difficult situations. Which is why its important in my opinion to when things don’t go your way to not see it as a bad thing because ultimately you don’t know if its really a bad thing as you can’t see into the future, equally you don’t know if a good thing is a good thing because you can’t see into the future. Point being is that you shouldn’t get let down when things don’t go according to the way you would like them to, just see them as blessings in disguise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also recommend that you follow the 10 commandments as these are principals that have been understood by the wisest amongst us and should be followed. With “thou shall not kill” also seek to understand the true meaning behind it, when you put someone’s idea down are you not killing their ambitions? Are you not killing their confidence to build things from their ideas? I leave you to ponder the full meaning behind “thou shall not kill”.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name><email>chrisisamazing@protonmail.com</email></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">Showing respect and love to God and his kingdom</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Faults</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/wellbeing/spiritual/Faults/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Faults" /><published>2021-08-03T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-08-03T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/wellbeing/spiritual/Faults</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/wellbeing/spiritual/Faults/">&lt;p&gt;In this short post I will talk a little bit about faults or flaws. Quite simply a fault or flaw is something that isn’t perfect or is hindering you in some way. An example of a fault could be self-sabotage, which in my opinion a lot of people have this flaw in some way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working on your flaws is in my opinion a fundamental aspect of following the spiritual life. We all have flaws every one of us, we may have flaws which affect us to a great extend such as in my case one of my flaws was when things don’t go my way I would make myself feel unhappy as a means of detesting the fact that things hadn’t gone my way or I would think that things are a total disaster and think that they will always be a disaster and really lingering on these thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody has different flaws; no two people will have the same flaws. We have personality flaws, social flaws, flaws with our thought processes, flaws with our beliefs. In every aspect of life there are flaws. But what is important is to identify flaws as best as you can, because as the Lao Tzu says in Tao Te Ching “When you identify a fault as a fault, can you no longer be with that fault” All this is quote is saying is that you first need to be able to identify a fault before you can seek to remove it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The means to remove a fault is fairly simple. To remove a fault you should send out a prayer to have that fault removed and then throughout your day anytime you notice that fault occurring you do your best to reject the fault, hence you need to engage in right mindfulness to be able to identify when you engage in this fault, as without mindfulness you wouldn’t be able to see when you are engaging in this fault. Over time this fault will lessen its impact on you as you constantly keep rejecting it and will gradually fade away from your makeup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that I noticed is that when you remove one fault, that fault was caused by another fault, and then that fault was also caused by another fault you had and so you just have this chain of faults until you get and master the very basics. For me I was removing a lot of faults in my makeup until I got to the root causes which was having and cultivating right thought and thus rejecting negative, dark thoughts because once you master your thoughts nobody can help you as much. Another fault I had was my attitude towards things was that it would end in a disaster which wasn’t a good attitude to have so I’m slowly but surely learning to reject this attitude and cultivate a more positive attitude towards things. You also engage in right effort when seeking to remove a fault as it takes a fair amount of effort to be able to constantly reject a fault.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name><email>chrisisamazing@protonmail.com</email></author><category term="Wellbeing" /><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">In this short post I will talk a little bit about faults or flaws.

&lt;p&gt;Here are some thought provoking things about happiness that I thought others might enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External events do they contain happiness within it? Is it the travelling to the destination that is what makes us happy? Is it the enjoyment that makes us happy? If it did anyone who experienced that event would be happy, but it’s not so. Also does the happiness last. perhaps it lasts for a few days, but it isn’t true lasting happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Items do they contain happiness? Does the material it’s made from contain the emotion of happiness? Does the way it was made and constructed contain happiness? How long does happiness last when you buy an item? A few days? Therefore, to find happiness you can’t find it in items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happiness cannot come from things which are temporary. To find lasting happiness it comes from within yourself. Nobody can make you truly happy, no event, no amount of material possessions can make you truly happy. It comes from within yourself and from an appreciation that nothing temporary can make you happy. As the Buddha himself once put “People are like a hamster on a wheel chasing after happiness endlessly from temporary things”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To become happy, you first need to really appreciate that nothing external will make you truly happy, no amount of money will make you happy, no amount of friends will make you happy, no amount of drugs or alcohol will make you happy. It comes from within yourself. Equally unhappiness is a choice. You don’t need to be unhappy, its only your reaction to external events that make you unhappy, for example you lose your job, is it the fact that you won’t have any money that makes you unhappy? Is it the fact you won’t see your work colleagues that is what makes you unhappy? Is it the fact that you think you won’t find another job that makes you unhappy? Point being is that there is a point where you make yourself unhappy as a result of something, not the event itself because the event itself doesn’t contain the emotion of unhappiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To become happy its important also to be as positive as you can possibly be. Try to see the light in every bad situation and also don’t give way to unhappiness and misery, no matter how disastrous you think it might be. Reject thoughts of it’s a disaster and try to see the reality of the situation, it could just be a blessing in disguise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to sum up. Happiness and unhappiness isn’t contained in external things, there is always a point where you make yourself happy or unhappy at external things. True happiness comes from within and to be happy its important first and foremost to try to be as positive as you can be and also rejecting any emotions of unhappiness and misery or thoughts that it’s a complete disaster, which is something that I have fallen to a number of times but I’m doing my best now to here on out rejecting thoughts that it’s a complete disaster and trying to give way to happiness as best as I can.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name><email>chrisisamazing@protonmail.com</email></author><category term="Wellbeing" /><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">Happiness part 2: Here are some thought provoking things about happiness that I thought others might enjoy.

For the past few months, I’ve been engaging in a lot of negative thought patterns about life in general. I realized that the reason I have such thoughts is because its my response to when things don’t go my way, I have these negative thoughts as a means of ‘protest’, which is extremely unhealthy. I’ve also felt so lost and one of the reasons why I think I’ve felt so lost is because I tried so hard to make myself unhappy and anytime, I would feel happy I would repress that feeling so that I could feel as unhappy and as miserable as possible. Which looking back I realized I was quite lost in doing this and if pressed to answer why I did it the closest thing I could come to is because I was angry and upset at the way I’ve been treated in life and so this was a means of protest against how I’ve been treated in life. Which is not very mature and has affected my vibration significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Buddha himself recognized the importance of thoughts saying “We are what we think. All that we are arises with our thoughts. With our thoughts we make the world”. It’s also one of the noble eightfold paths Right thought being the second part of the noble eightfold path which goes to show the significance that the Buddha put on having the right thoughts. I also like this quote “Your worst enemy can not harm you as much as your own thoughts, unguarded. But once mastered, no one can help you as much, not even your father or your mother.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What it means to have right thought to me means that you reject thoughts that are in their nature negative and try to cultivate positive thoughts such as kindness to people, love for people etc. Personally, I would have a lot of thoughts which brought me unhappiness and misery. I engaged in these thoughts so much that I somewhat lost what it actually feels to be happy and when I’m ‘happy’ really, it’s just a feeling of satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for me I am going to begin rejecting negative thoughts as best as I can and also rejecting unhappiness as best as I can. I’m also going to try and be as positive as I can about things. I hope that in time with this practice I can begin to become a much happier and spiritually awake person, because being unhappy and miserable doesn’t benefit anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize I have a mountain to climb in terms of the negative, dark, dare I say evil thoughts that have been going through me and what I need to do to conquer such thoughts.  Also, the general feeling of unhappiness I’ve been pushing on to myself which has affected my vibration as have my thoughts. I feel it’s also made me weak minded or feeble in mind as I really can’t engage my mind as I used to as a result of all the unhappiness, I’ve been pushing onto myself. But as they say the journey of a thousand miles begins with one step and I like to think that this is a giant step in the correct direction to becoming an ‘ascended being’ which is something I aspire to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this has taught me whole affair I like to think has taught me a valuable lesson in the importance of not giving way to bad thoughts and also the importance of being happy and thereby rejecting unhappiness and misery, because it really has affected my motivation to do things in that because I have this general feeling of unhappiness I’m a lot less willing to do things because my view of the world has been affected negatively.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name><email>chrisisamazing@protonmail.com</email></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">I wanted to make this short post about thoughts and the importance of them and the importance of not giving way to unhappiness in your life and pushing happiness as best as you can.

&lt;p&gt;Let me first say that pushing yourself down when there is a difficult situation is not the answer. Giving yourself unnecessary mental suffering for a difficult situation is not the answer. Taking it out on others is not the answer. Not taking the situation as serious to shield yourself from damage is not the answer which is something that I do as I really don’t like see serious things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthy responses lie in attuning yourself to the reality of the situation. What this means is you appreciate that its a difficult situation and you may not get the expected result that you want, as a result don’t beat yourself up if you don’t get the result that you want. We are all human after all. If we got the result that we wanted all the time it would be an easy world to live in. Also accept that one person’s difficult situation is different to another person’s difficult situation. We are all different, what’s easy for one may be difficult for another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should try your best nontheless and just appreciate that its a difficult situation. Also don’t avoid difficult situations and don’t accept defeat so easily, you may do a lot better than you anticipated, see it as a learning experience. To grow its implied that we will need to be faced with difficult situations, so see them as a blessing not as a punishment.&lt;/p&gt;

Giving yourself unnecessary mental suffering for a difficult situation is not the answer. Taking it out on others is not the answer. Not taking the situation as serious to shield yourself from damage is not the answer which is something that I do as I really don’t like see serious things. Healthy responses lie in attuning yourself to the reality of the situation.

Being better is a relative term and one person’s ‘being better’ is different to another person’s ‘being better’. But ideally you should strive to be the best version of yourself. Whatever that version of yourself might be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First let me just say that you need to strive to be better for yourself. If you try to be better for others it will fail. Also when you’re striving to be better you may have negative opinions of others because of the bad acts that you were doing before you wanted to be better. Please refer to my post &lt;a href=&quot;https://lovehumanity.gitlab.io/wellbeing/spiritual/Self-Forgiveness/&quot;&gt;self-forgiveness&lt;/a&gt; which will help you understand better how to forgive yourself for any bad acts that you did before you wanted to be better. But don’t allow the opinions of others to impact you and your pursuit of betterment. Let them have their opinions. Speak through your actions, not your words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally for me being better is the removal of flaws that restrict me in someway. Its also means praying constantly for the removal of flaws and Gods blessings. It also means meditating so that I can develop my aura and my hgiher bodies and thereby become more intuitive. Its also having healthy views about yourself, the outside world and other people as spoked about in this ted talk on being mentally strong linked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbv757kup4&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, don’t be deterred by failure. Failure happens as do mistakes, feel free to read my post on learning from mistakes linked &lt;a href=&quot;https://lovehumanity.gitlab.io/wellbeing/spiritual/Learning-From-Mistakes/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; Just persevere with it and you will improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shout out to everyone that has supported me during my journey, couldn’t get to where I am without the support.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name><email>chrisisamazing@protonmail.com</email></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">In this short post I will talk a little bit about being better.

&lt;p&gt;The irony of this problem is that most people want to be special in someway, whether that be trying to be a master at their subject, buying clothes that make them feel special, everyone has their own subtle ways to trying to be speical. But if everyone wants to be special then how can anyone be special? Therefore, to be special you need to want to not be special and instead aim to be ordinary. Its quite the paradox. As the Tao Te Ching says “Do not wish to be shiny like jade, be dull like rocks”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also this is similar to something that I realised recently and that is I strived to be great, I would base my goals on my own notion of what it meant to be great. But I came to the realisation that I don’t need to be. My motives behind wanting to be great were flawed because I was only doing so because I felt that I was inferior in some way and so for me to not be inferior I needed to be great. I then understood that I can be great (you can be anything you want to be in this world) but I was doing it with ill intent and therefore I shouldn’t strive to be great. Therefore I was truely great&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be special. Strive to be ordinary and then you will be truely special.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name><email>chrisisamazing@protonmail.com</email></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">In this short post I will talk a little on being ordinary, or in other words ‘not being special’</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Know Your Limits</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/wellbeing/Know-Your-Limits/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Know Your Limits" /><published>2021-06-08T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-06-08T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/wellbeing/Know-Your-Limits</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/wellbeing/Know-Your-Limits/">&lt;p&gt;In this short post I will talk a little bit about limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their limits. By limits I mean how much a person can tolerate before they have a mental breakdown of some sort. Limits take the form of  emotional limits, mental limits, stress limits etc. What I think is quite important is to know and understand your limits, know how much you can tolerate and how much you can’t. I’m not afraid to admit that I have really pushed the boundaries with my mental limits and its led to a lot of pain and mental suffering which is really unhealthy and also unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also what you should understand is everyone has their own limits associated to them. My limits will almost certainly be different to your limits. But I feel like its important to be understanding of other people’s limits. Also you should identify things that trigger your limits so that you can better understand and recongise if/when something will push you to that limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I stuggle with basic things in that my trigggers for my limits can be simple things which leads me to a lot of mental stuggle for things that would be easy to most people, which I suppose is actually a disability. I also engage in a lot of self-sabotage which I know is unhealthy but at least I recognize it unlike most people I feel. In fact I argue that self-sabotage is the number one reason why most people don’t achieve what they set out for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the important thing is that you know your limits with how much mental sturggle, emotional stuggle you are able to deal with at a given time. This Ted talk about the secret to becoming mentally strong linked &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFbv757kup4&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; really put it in perspective for me because this video argues that to do so you need healthy views about yourself, the world and other people and I realise that I have a lot of really unhealthy views about the outside world which I’m working on which can trigger my limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also unrelated but this song from Erra hits home for me if interested check it out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swAvmmkBCzs&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name><email>chrisisamazing@protonmail.com</email></author><category term="Wellbeing" /><summary type="html">In this short post I will talk a little bit about limits.
