Sometimes I take things to extremes and it has caused me and others alot of suffering.

I guess the reason I do that is because I desire something and don't yet fully appreciate that all desire and wants will inveitably lead to suffering and it's as the saying goes you can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink.

It's also a means of repressing my trauma that I've gone through in my life and I will make a post describing my trauma soon. 

I also wrongly have this belief that I need to please others and be a good person all the time, which is just wrong because I don't need to be a good person if I chose not to be and this doesn't make me s bad person, because what makes a good person? It's relative what makes a good person and should be your own interpretation of what it means to be a good person.

But you shouldn't take it in extremes because it can be too much of a good thing which is a form of evil, it's also about desire because you desire to be a good person and this leads to suffering. 

It also plays into how I can be arrogant and ignorant which isn't good because it's just difficult for me to listen to others because I think that all people sometimes just want me to suffer.

The solution is of course to strive for balance in things and never take things too personally and never take things to extremes because you can commit sins in taking things to extremes i.e thou shall not kill.
