&lt;p&gt;The solution I feel to not having too much of a good thing is only take that which you can handle. Don’t feel you are letting others down in rejecting their good things they sent to you because you can have too much of a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also about slowing down because with me being in dark for so so long and suddenly being in the light I realized that like I was just having so many good things as a means of compensating for being in dark for so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My general advice would be to realize when you are having too much of a good thing and so slow down when you feel your having too much of a good thing and also to not be greedy in the good things that you have, but express gratitude for all the good things that are coming your way and the good things that you already have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that I’ve put a lot of posts on my blog,, but the reason I put these all in a massive batch like this is due to me being in a mental hospital and having a lot lot more time to better understand myself and thereby make considerable progress towards God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it’s about taking your time and don’t feel you need to rush because of others, because when you rush the whole world rushes because you make up the world. So take your time and remember that the journey is a marathon not a sprint so enjoy each and every moment of it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">When You Cant Do Good Do Good Elsewhere</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/When-You-Cant-Do-Good-Do-Good-Elsewhere/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="When You Cant Do Good Do Good Elsewhere" /><published>2022-02-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-02-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/When-You-Cant-Do-Good-Do-Good-Elsewhere</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/When-You-Cant-Do-Good-Do-Good-Elsewhere/">&lt;p&gt;In this short post I will talk a little about how when you can’t do good because of some reason like a disagreement with yourself or a flaw you have that you should do good elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I’ve suffered a lot and that suffering has really made me into the person that I am today, but I put efforts to see the good in what that suffering has brought to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also realized that I sometimes can’t do good in the world because I can be selfish sometimes, but in such times I realized that I compensate that by doing good some place else, which isn’t a bad thing at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also realized that this is a really good prinicipal to live by that if you can’t do good in your own home, seek to do good elsewhere in the world because you are not the only person in the world and it’s important that you stay true to yourself and your own beliefs in things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I just wanted to add that you should have good intentions when following this simple principal. By good intentions I mean serving God, helping others etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good that you can seek to do is endless, offer your service as a volunteer in someway, donate some money to charity, give your money to a friend in need, phone a friend you haven’t spoken to in some time. Point being is that when you can’t do good in your own home for some reason, seek to do good elsewhere in the world because it will be the world a much better place for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><summary type="html">In this short post I will talk a little about how when you can’t do good because of some reason like a disagreement with yourself or a flaw you have that you should do good elsewhere.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Self-Importance</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Self-Importance/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Self-Importance" /><published>2022-02-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-02-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Self-Importance</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Self-Importance/">&lt;p&gt;I realize that I can be incredibly foolish, silly and ignorant sometimes My own sense of self-importance has let me down considerably and to think that I know better than others and God is foolish to think that way because God is in complete control of absolutely everything. People shouldn’t think they are better than others because of their perceived spiritual blessings they have received as a result of their faifth in God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve let myself and the world down considerably due to thinking that I’m more important than others which is wrong because everyone and everything is equal even God himself in the eyes of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I foolishly chose self-importance over others and I was too arrogant and blinded by ignorance and prideful to see what it was I was doing to myself. All those times I hurt and deceived people and lied to their faces when they said “are you ok”? And not being as honest as I should be to them and saying “yeam i’m fine” when I just wasn’t. But also not being true to myself and my own beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my own self-importance got in the way significantly in terms of making real tangeable progress towards God and I have been a complete and utter fool towards myself and let others down which isn’t what I stand for. But I have let others down and more importantly I’ve let myself down and the life of progress towards God which I would like to lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will continue to pray and meditate as best as I can each day to God in the hopes that I can change for the benefit of the human species and more importantly for the benefit of myself. Its wrong what I’ve done to myself and zeaoulsly evil to have done all the things that I’ve done to myself and to think I can get away with it is stupid and foolish and to think that others can’t see my own actions is fooling myself. Praying that I reduce my pride (which I have done now) and reduce my own sense of importance. But I feel the pace of spirtuality is far too fast and should slow down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own sense of self-importance isn’t who I want to be anymore in terms of how I identify with being very important. I should respect myself and others more to recognize that I have been given life and so should put efforts into doing God’s work and not the work of the devil/evil. I’m sorry towards myself for having done the things that I have done to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess its also about how I was in darkness for so long and now I’m begginging to see the light considerably more I wandered why I was in darkness for so so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work of God should be in creating beautfy, lifting people’s spirits especially people who are down, expressing christ like emotions to others and more importantly yourself, striving to be happy, striving to be joyful, giving to others especially because the power of giving is true in the sense that what you give to others you get in return in the sense that you reap what you sow, but you should give with the belief that God will return to you what you give to others, but you shouldn’t to so for yourself – you should do so with the intent of serving God. Practing self-love more and being more positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I gave way to so much self-importance is due to me not recognizeing the oneness of all life and realizing that I’m not the only person in the world and its also incredibly selfish to not believe in the word of God.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">I realize that I can be incredibly foolish, silly and ignorant sometimes My own sense of self-importance has let me down considerably and to think that I know better than others and God is foolish to think that way because God is in complete control of absolutely everything.

&lt;p&gt;I guess the reason that I haven’t spoken to many woman in my life is due to my relationship with myself mainly, but also due to lack of courage and self-confidence and also that like I feel it will bring me more suffering because I for some reason feel its better that you are ‘stronger’ if you are alone and have no partner in your life because then you won’t suffer the loss of them. Which I now see is quite foolish of me because love between two people should be a wonderful thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like with the pandemic some people are feeling incredibly sexually frustrated because of how lockdowns are making it harder and harder to meet and greet new people and things like bars and restaurants are becoming more descriminated against because you need to show vaccine certrficates and tack and trace depending on where you are in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I feel like if you meet a certain partner who you can relate to and enjoy then you should bond and have a realtionship, rather than being seperated because you will feel a lot happier together and won’t feel as llost as most people who are single feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also feel a deep sense of lacking within yourself as you feel your heart mourne for someone else and company with another. Sometimes you can express your sexual frustation through dream sleep, but its important to not beat yourself up too much about having sex with people through dreams sleep because its a natural and healthy thing for people to do, but just seek to not break one of the ten commandments thu shall not commit adultery because its wrong to have sex with family members even if it is through dream sleep because its unfair and unhealthy because it is harmful to family life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technique to meet your new partner which I read from The Great White Brotherhood’s book the stairway to freedom (and a link to their website and free books are in my about page) is to sit quietely and tell God that you are ready to receive your perfect partner and thank him for sneidng you your perfect partner. It may take a number of weeks/months/years even to mee this person, but God’s angels will ensure that you two meet each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to add that you need to be willing to change with regard to meeting your perfet partner because a lot of people have flaws which will undermine the wonderful and beautfiul relationship that they wish to have together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also not beat yourself too much in the ways that you express your sexual frustation, there is no shame in how you express it. But seek to channel your sexual frustation into desire to change that sexual frustation and find a woman/man in your life, seek to goto places like parks, to bars, to nightclubs, to restaruatns, to socieities, weddings etc and just seek to put yourself out there is my general advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly I just wanted to add that I really lack affection a lot and have suffered tremendously from a lack of affection and that is mainly due to feeling the need to be ‘strong’ and is due to toxic masculinity which I feel our society doesn’t address enough because I still suffer from a lack of affection towards others and struggle to receive a lack of affection.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">This one is a touchy subject for me because I have experienced considerable sexual frustration and has mainfested itself in very peculiar ways, and much of which i’m not very proud of.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Suffering and the Four Noble Truths</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/buddhism/Suffering-and-the-four-noble-truths/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Suffering and the Four Noble Truths" /><published>2022-02-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-02-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/spiritual/buddhism/Suffering-and-the-four-noble-truths</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/buddhism/Suffering-and-the-four-noble-truths/">&lt;p&gt;In this artcile I will talk about suffering. Which for me is a subject mattar that I have struggled with a lot, in terms of how to deal with suffering and how to resolve suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will first say that I have suffered tremendously as a result of demonic possession, I have experienced considerable mental suffering as a result of being possessed when I was 17 because the demonic personality is still there, but it has somewhat lessened a lot due to not being tempted to use its personality which is still there. I will also just add that I was exercised with help from The Great White Brotherhood, which you can find a link in the about page of my blog to their website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also foolishly believed that the means out of suffering was to give way to evil, but it defintelety wasn’t because I just suffered a great deal more and it has cost me more than anyone could ever know. I don’t think that anyone should resolve their problems by giving way to evil or give way to evil for that mattar – feel free to check out my article on evil that I wrote which may help you with your own evil &lt;a href=&quot;https://lovehumanity.gitlab.io/spiritual/Evil/&quot;&gt;https://lovehumanity.gitlab.io/spiritual/Evil/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furhtermore I also realized that I make myself suffer in the present moment through like mental suffering, emotional suffering, making others suffer in the hopes of preventing further suffering, which is just not the means out of suffering. I guess it was mainly due to a total lack of courage in terms of worrying too much for the future and thinking that other people have more power over me. But you should know that you have complete autotomy over yourself whether you belive it or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Buddhism the means out of suffering is to follow the four noble truths and to meditate on them as it is wisdom from a very wise master the Buddha. Practicing the eightfold path is indeed the path out of suffering, but for me I struggle with understanding why that is and should really meditate and spend more time contemplating why it is the noble eightfold path is the means out of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first noble truth is that life is inheriently suffering, in life we suffer through things like physical suffering, mental suffering, emotional suffering and it is an inevitability that everyone will suffer in some way in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second noble truth is that change is a constant thing in life, and there is no stopping change suffering has a cause and we try to manipulate sitations, people and try to get our way. But the important thing to remember about the second noble truth is that disastification arises within us. Its you that are disasstified with the current position of the fact that you are going to suffer and that no mattar what you do life is inherientely suffering&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third noble truth which is perhaps the hardest one to grasp is that the cause of suffering is desire and attachment to things or disasstification as the Buddha describes it, because for me I realize that I have a lot of wants and also somewhat realize that not everyone can have what they want in life which is a universal truth and I guess I just need to be more accepting of this fact. Then I realize that I take it out on myself somewhat when I can’t have what I want because of my own arrognace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth noble truth is the promise that you can end your suffering and the suffering of others by teaching the noble four truths through ahering to the noble eightfold path. Which is right understanding, right intentions, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right concentration, right mindfulness. I won’t go into too much detail but this is the means out of suffering. Which I am still putting efforts to recognize.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><category term="Buddhism" /><summary type="html">In this artcile I will talk about suffering.

This will be similar to my article I wrote on self-compassion but it applies to giving others compassion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing that you need to accept is that you need to have good intent when attempting to provide someone with compassion. If there isn’t good intent, then comapssion will not be as effective. As with any other chirst like emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also just wanted to add what is meant by suffering and really it’s just disasstisffaction in how your experience is right now and can take the form as it has with mine in terms of mental suffering, emotional suffering, you can suffer also from your false beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You first need to connect with the person and put efforts to understand and appreciate the suffering that they are going through. But see them on a deeper levela nd also respect them. I have struggled with giving compassion to others and still struggle because I feel I can be very ignorant and selfish sometimes because of my own self-importance, which I’ve struggled with a lot in my life and plan on posting my article on self-importance that I wrote very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that the key thing with compassion is emptahy also with the person and putting efforts to see the suffering they are going through. But seeing the person behind the suffering and accepting them as they are and having a deep level of compassion for what they’ve been throguh and what they are going through right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for me I’ve also realized that I just suffer for the sake of suffering and this is due to my delusion of how to end suffering I should suffer in the present to avoid further suffering in the future and I realized that following the noble four truths of Buddhism has helped me out of suffering and the eightfold path is the path out of suffering, which I recommend all who read this to take more seriously because it will end your suffering that you go through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also realized that I somewhat identified with my suffering and allowed it to control me, and was foolishly somewhat proud of my suffering as I felt that suffering gives you strength, but not to ghte degree I have suffered and made others suffer as a result of my own suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you shouldn’t just give compassion out blindly all the time because they may expect that compassion all the time and then they won’t learn from their mistakes of not understanding the nature of suffering and how the noble eightfold path is indeed the way out of suffering. Which is why I feel it’s important to teach to others why they suffer and it’s due to desire and attacthment to things, because when you attach and desire and no longer have those things then you suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Desire can be anything, you desire for the future to be a certain way, you desire for others to behave a certain way, you desire for the world to be a certain way, but the solution is to have no desire, because all suffering is caused by desire. It’s also about attachment because people attach themselves to items, luxury clothing, the past, the future, people, situations – I.e they want a situation to go a certain way etc and so when these things are no longer with you – you suffer. The solution is to have no desire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead of trying to change the world, seek to change yourself before you change others because you are not yet perfect and have a long journey ahead of you as do we all. But just take the journey in strides and don’t try to rush it because of others, enjoy every moment of it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">I thought I would write this article on compassion.

&lt;p&gt;I realized that one thing that has caused me suffering and many others suffering is patronization which is whereby you think that you are better than others and so in very subtle ways have behaviors which condescend them in someway. But its also about thinking that you can get the better of others in someway and you think that you are more intelligent than others which is quite arrogant because we are all equal and to patronize another isn’t in line with reality because you are not better or lesser than anyone or anything else. Everyone and everything is equal in the eyes of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To patronize is also to kill another’s confidence in themselves which goes against one of the ten commandments thou shall not kill. But I realized that I also patronize myself in a way which isn’t good for me to do that because we and everything is equal, but I just struggle to accept that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I also find its important to call out patronization if and when someone does it to you because it affects your self-esteem when someone patronizes you in someway and you just accept it and think that the other person is better than you in someway because when you patronize another its puts them down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should learn to have the courage to stand up to people whom patronize you in someway and learn to not judge those who patronize you in someway because we are all on our separate journeys. Just as a short note you shouldn’t think that you are more spiritually advanced than someone else because they still patronize. We are all far from perfect. You should be accepting of all life as all is one and to harm another is to harm yourself. Which took me a lot longer than it should have to realize that harming yourself isn’t good because its yourself that you are doing it to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, seek to understand people a lot more and be forgiving to those who patronize you and forgiving to those who judge you. But learn to be your own person and not allow yourself to patronize another and not allow yourself to be patronized by others, but stand up for yourself and what you believe. Not what others want you to believe. Become more mindful of your intentions and recognize more when you patronize others. Its in very subtle ways that people patronize you and you patronize others. But learn to be more understanding and forgiving of when people do this kind of thing because they don’t recognize the oneness of all of life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">Patronizing Others</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Rushing Spirituality</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Rushing-Spirituality/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Rushing Spirituality" /><published>2022-01-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-01-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Rushing-Spirituality</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Rushing-Spirituality/">&lt;p&gt;Rushing Spirituality&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized that one thing that is holding me back a lot now that I am starting to see some results with my spiritual advances I feel the need to rush spirituality for more gains because I have been in the dark for so long now and given way to a lot of negative thoughts and been quite depressed and just felt so lost. But now that I am starting to see some results with spirituality I am willing to learn lot about myself a lot more because I can see that there are indeed significant gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one thing that I learned during my rush for spirituality is that it can damage yourself significantly if you are not careful, and so my advice would be to practice spirituality in your own time and at your own pace. Some people progress faster than others, while others progress slowly. But you shouldn’t judge how fast/slow someone progresses in their spirituality because its not a contest or a race, I guess one of the reasons I feel the need to rush in spirituality is because of fear of suffering and I realize that this is in part due to me not realizing the nature of suffering and that following the Buddha’s noble eightfold path is indeed the way out of suffering, because the Buddha is one of the great masters of this world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But also the fact that I suffer from mental health difficulties is in part one of the reasons why I rush, because I worry too much about how others judge me, in part because I don’t accept that I have mental health difficulties because I’m too egotistical, arrogant, prideful to accept that I do have mental health difficulties. I feel like ego does get in the way sometimes, but I don’t often recognize it. Ego also affects my ability to trust other people, because I can be antisocial when I choose to be which does make me quite lonely and I feel a lot of people suffer from this similar thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that I realize also is it should be about the journey that is of importance. I know its a little cliche, but that is true. But I don’t quite see that, or accept it as truth hence why I’ve been rushing spirituality out of fear of losing out on something (suffering).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, go at your own pace in spirituality and only practice spirituality if you do want to develop. You don’t have to practice spirituality if you don’t choose to and also its important to take breaks with spirituality when you feel the need to. But the gains that can be made are big.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">Rushing Spirituality</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Self-Worth</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Self-Worth/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Self-Worth" /><published>2022-01-18T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-01-18T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Self-Worth</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Self-Worth/">&lt;p&gt;Self-Worth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-Worth is something I have struggled with my entire life, I guess its like somewhat due to my personality flaws and how due to these flaws others don’t accept me as much because I kind of like think its right to put myself down in some way because of lack of acceptance of who I really am. Which I think equates to holiness in someway, but I realize its incredibly stupid and unfair on others and the rest of the world but its also important in the fact that you put yourself down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But its also like am I enough? When will I be enough? What makes someone enough? I guess its in part due to my lack of acceptance of myself, I guess in part due to my personality flaws which essentially mean that the people whom I interact with don’t respect me as much as I would like them to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My own sense of humor gets in the way a lot of the time in my advancements towards God. But I’m quite arrogant and ignorant of that fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But its also I realized that I think others are better than me, or that they have more to offer than I do. But most don’t. I guess its in part due to self-confidence and confidence in yourself because I guess its something that I lack and need to work upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which I guess plays into this flaw that is quite serious whereby I think sensitivity or being sensitive equates in someway to holiness in someway. But it definitely doesn’t because you essentially just become a slave to other people and are not fulfilling your own wants and needs. But I realize that you should seek to be true to yourself and not be a slave to others expectations of you. Its also about sticking to your guns in the face of adversary and your enemy and taking a stand against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I realized that I trust God, more than I trust myself. But the trust between yourself and God should be equal because all is one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But also because I think it makes you humble in not recognizing your own achievements and accomplishments, but it isn’t – you just become devoid of the reality of your own worth to the world. Which is unfair towards yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its also unfair to not accept your own talents and powers and skill and think that its selfish to give way to your own skills and talents, when it simply isn’t because it undermines your own self-worth and makes you think that you are powerless in the face of opposition, when you are not. Then it just makes you hate and despise yourself when you just take so much stuff from others and don’t stand up for yourself when you are perfectly capable of taking a stand and giving into your own skills and talents. Its also unfair on others and the world when you don’t give into your natural talents and gifts and it makes you look a fool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also hurts your self-esteem when you have such low self-worth. Having low self-worth also makes you doubt yourself, which then causes you to have low self-confidence and then it affects how others perceive you because when you are constantly doubting your decisions it just makes you appear weak when you are not. Having doubts also affects you ability to have beliefs about things based on reality. Due to stigma around mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess ultimately the reason I have given into so much self-doubt is mainly due to evil because evil makes you doubt yourself a lot and the solution to doubting yourself is to not care what others think of you and making someone doubt themselves goes against the 10 commandments of thou shall not kill because you are killing their confidence and ability to believe in themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">Self-Worth</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Evil</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Evil/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Evil" /><published>2022-01-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-01-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Evil</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/spiritual/Evil/">&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, I will say here that evil is a very seductive power. You need to be an advanced being I believe to not be seduced by evil. But what most people who give way to this evil don’t actually realize is that evil is controlling their actions significantly more than they are controlling their own actions. I will also say that evil generally has this very red kind of energy that consumes the person and clouds their ability to see reality clearly because they are so consumed by this evil which in turn makes them very ignorant, arrogant, and selfish towards the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to say that nothing good can be achieved by giving way to evil. The only thing that evil brings is suffering to yourself and suffering to others through destruction. I also want to add that being so evil it removes any amount of sincerity that you may have had, evil also I feel brings out the more negative aspects which make us human for example arrogance, ignorance, neglect etc. I find that I can be very ignorant when I chose to be, which is quite selfish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, when you give way to evil so much you thereby block more of the positive aspects to yourself such as the ability to feel more positive things, such as joy, happiness, love, sincerity because evil has so much power over you. You become someone you were never supposed to be. What is worse is that most evil people don’t recognize that evil has so much power over them which is limiting the power of God and limiting their positive emotions, they wrongly believe that they have control over evil and that evil gives them power. The power of God is a lot more powerful than the power of evil, but you need to open yourself up more to the power of God by reducing the very things that evil seeks to promote like pride, arrogance, ignorance, selfishness etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The power of evil also attempts to undermine things that you think about yourself. Such as your own worth to the world, it seeks to put you in a corner and casts judgements upon you on the kind of person that you should be, it seeks to turn you into a fool, it seeks to make you doubt yourself, it seeks to make you experience mental suffering, emotional suffering, physical suffering. But what is worse is that those who use evil, will become so seduced by its power that the evil will actually turn on them and destroy them and their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also just wanted to add quickly is that when you are so influenced by evil you may notice what is known as throught block, which is where the power of evil actually is so powerful it prevents the thought coming through to your mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, you should seek to pray to God each day that he keeps you from evil. Only the power of God keeps the power of evil away, nothing else can prevent the power of evil. If you yourself are able to see that you are being influenced by evil in someway pray to God that you reduce the power that evil has over, you and pray that you reduce the temptation it has over you. If you recognize that others are being influenced to do evil, seek to pray for them so that you can increase the power of God in the world and help to reduce the evil in the world and the suffering that’s in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updated 1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also realized that evil basically makes you doubt yourself a lot and destroys your mind and self-esteem. But evil makes you think that this is who you are. But you identify with whatever you choose to identify with, also people that are so consumed by evil don’t actually see that evil is harming themselves because all is one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When consumed by evil is makes it difficult for you to judge things for yourself and makes you doubt your own sanity, it also clouds your ability to receive more positive thoughts and more positive things, constructive things, and makes you identify with those evil thoughts and makes you think that the evil thoughts are your thoughts and the thoughts that you should have. Then it becomes difficult for you to judge if your thoughts are evil or good because evil has a form of power, but that power is nothing compared to the power of God. Therefore if you suspect that you are under the powers of evil you should seek to pray to God that he rids you of this evil - granted it is difficult to do this esepcially if you are so consumed by evil as I was. But the act of prayer in itself shows that you want to be rid of evil. But you need to mean it in your heart that you want to convert to the side of good and are willing to put efforts into yourself that you will change for the benefit of yourself and your fellow man because there is no fooling God, the rewards are very high for doing Gods work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True evil, true evil utlimately leads to mutilation of the self (in my case it was the holy spirit that was being mutilated, not my physical body), which is not good and I’m ashamed that I did such things to myself. Mainly because I didn’t see myself as myself which is an unusual sentence, but I had complete faifth in God that he was able to heal me if I do such things - which I now realize is not an excuse to do such things and is unfair on those working on healing me because I don’t want to see it and the damage done, but they are the ones that have to see it and are kind enough to heal such things, but its just ultimately unfair on them, but more importantly unfair on yourself. But its not just yourself whom you let down when you give way to evil and mutilation, but its also the people who care about you, which is unfair on them and unfair on yourself in letting them down. Another small point is that if you feel attracted to evil you shouldn’t devoid yourself of those experiences because you should only relinquish evil to the extent that you see the wrongness in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly when you are evil you essentially allign your actions with sin and will just do anything and everything to sin, which is not good because you are harming yourself when you hurt others because all is one. When relinquishing evil seek to be more mindful of when you are sinning and seek to be more mindful of your intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you know I feel that ultimately a lot of the issues that I have stem from my relationship with myself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chris</name></author><category term="Spiritual" /><summary type="html">First and foremost, I will say here that evil is a very seductive power.
