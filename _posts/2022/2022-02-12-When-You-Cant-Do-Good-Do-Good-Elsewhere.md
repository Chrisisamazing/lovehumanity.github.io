In this short post I will talk a little about how when you can't do good because of some reason like a disagreement with yourself or a flaw you have that you should do good elsewhere. 

Firstly, I've suffered a lot and that suffering has really made me into the person that I am today, but I put efforts to see the good in what that suffering has brought to the world.

I also realized that I sometimes can't do good in the world because I can be selfish sometimes, but in such times I realized that I compensate that by doing good some place else, which isn't a bad thing at all.

I also realized that this is a really good prinicipal to live by that if you can't do good in your own home, seek to do good elsewhere in the world because you are not the only person in the world and it's important that you stay true to yourself and your own beliefs in things. 

But I just wanted to add that you should have good intentions when following this simple principal. By good intentions I mean serving God, helping others etc. 

The good that you can seek to do is endless, offer your service as a volunteer in someway, donate some money to charity, give your money to a friend in need, phone a friend you haven't spoken to in some time. Point being is that when you can't do good in your own home for some reason, seek to do good elsewhere in the world because it will be the world a much better place for everyone.
