I"¯<p>My name is Chris and welcome to my small blog on the internet. I live in the UK and am aged between 18-24. I maintain this blog here partly for my own personal development and spiritual journey and also to help others along the way.</p>

<p>In this Blog You‚Äôll find articles on the following topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wellbeing</li>
  <li>Spiritual Topics</li>
  <li>Self-Improvement</li>
  <li>Anything else I deem important enough to share with the world</li>
</ul>

<p>Also a side note that the articles on this blog are not very long in length because I like to keep it quick and to the point and avoid ‚Äòfiller‚Äô as much as possible, which is what I see a lot of articles I read do.</p>

<h2 id="awesome-subjects-mag">Awesome Subjects :mag:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Buddhism <em>(Desire is the cause of suffering)</em></li>
  <li>Psychology _(Teleology - ALl human behaviour stems from a goal) _</li>
  <li>Spirituality <em>(I can be better, therefore I will strive to be)</em></li>
  <li>Economics <em>(The fed be printing money for days!)</em></li>
  <li>Taoism <em>(‚ÄúWhen you identify a flaw as a flaw, you no longer be with that flaw‚Äù)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I find that all subjects are linked together. Really it comes down to how you define the information in a subject. For example Buddhism a religion or philosophy whichever way you wish to view it links strongly with Psychology. Then that links with economics because of how people trade etc, etc. Point being is that all subjects are intertwined in some way.</p>

<h2 id="cool-quotes-speech_balloon">Cool Quotes :speech_balloon:</h2>

<p>‚ÄúI am but a mirror whose only real purpose is to show you what your own eyes do not see‚Äù ~ Kreia</p>

<p>‚ÄúBe the person that you want to be in life‚Äù ~ Me</p>

<p>‚ÄúGreater in battle than the man who would conquer a thousand-thousand men, is he who would conquer just one - himself‚Äù ~ Buddha</p>

<p>‚ÄúPeace begins when the expectation ends‚Äù ~ Buddha</p>

<p>‚ÄúWhen I let go of what I am, I become what I might be‚Äù ~ Lao Tzu</p>

<p>‚ÄúBe the change that you want to see in the world‚Äù ~ Ghandi</p>

<p>‚ÄúPray for thy enemies‚Äù ~ Jesus Christ</p>

<p>‚ÄúNone of us live in an objective world, but instead in a subjective world that we ourselves have given meaning to. The world you see is different from the one I see, and it‚Äôs impossible to share your world with anoyne else‚Äù ~ The Courage to be Disliked</p>

<p>‚ÄúYour worst enemy can not harm you as much as your own thoughts unguarded. But once mastered, no on can help you as much, not even your mother or Father‚Äù ~ Buddha</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe greatest warrior is the one that wins without fighting‚Äù ~ Lao Tzu</p>

<h2 id="the-great-white-brotherhood">The Great White Brotherhood</h2>

<p>If you are serious about spirituality feel free to check out this group that claim to have had an earthly incarnation and transmit messages via an earthly instrument The Great White Brotherhood, great meaning large in number, white implying nobility and brotherhood meaning a collective. They transmit various spiritual books that are in heaven to assist us. Their book the stairway to freedom has been a book that has greately helped me in my spiritual journey and I hope it does for you also.</p>

<p>Be warned if you don‚Äôt have an open mind you will likely dismiss the information as false.</p>

<h2 id="how-this-blog-is-hosted-completely-free-heavy_dollar_sign">How this blog is hosted Completely Free :heavy_dollar_sign:</h2>

<p>This blog is hosted using gitlab pages and Jekyll using the <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/">Minimal Mistakes theme</a> which allows me to host this blog completely free. I chose gitlab to host this blog because gitlab is <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab">more open source</a> than github which is completly <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24254324/is-github-com-source-code-open-source">closed sourced</a>. Personally I find it quite ironic that a website that hosts so much open source code isn‚Äôt itself open source, its a bit like writing a book on the importance of giving to others, and yet turning a profit for said book.</p>
