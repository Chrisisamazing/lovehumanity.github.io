        <p>In this artcile I will talk about suffering. Which for me is a subject mattar that I have struggled with a lot, in terms of how to deal with suffering and how to resolve suffering.</p>

<p>I will first say that I have suffered tremendously as a result of demonic possession, I have experienced considerable mental suffering as a result of being possessed when I was 17 because the demonic personality is still there, but it has somewhat lessened a lot due to not being tempted to use its personality which is still there. I will also just add that I was exercised with help from The Great White Brotherhood, which you can find a link in the about page of my blog to their website.</p>

<p>I also foolishly believed that the means out of suffering was to give way to evil, but it defintelety wasn’t because I just suffered a great deal more and it has cost me more than anyone could ever know. I don’t think that anyone should resolve their problems by giving way to evil or give way to evil for that mattar – feel free to check out my article on evil that I wrote which may help you with your own evil <a href="https://lovehumanity.gitlab.io/spiritual/Evil/">https://lovehumanity.gitlab.io/spiritual/Evil/</a></p>

<p>Furhtermore I also realized that I make myself suffer in the present moment through like mental suffering, emotional suffering, making others suffer in the hopes of preventing further suffering, which is just not the means out of suffering. I guess it was mainly due to a total lack of courage in terms of worrying too much for the future and thinking that other people have more power over me. But you should know that you have complete autotomy over yourself whether you belive it or not.</p>

<p>In Buddhism the means out of suffering is to follow the four noble truths and to meditate on them as it is wisdom from a very wise master the Buddha. Practicing the eightfold path is indeed the path out of suffering, but for me I struggle with understanding why that is and should really meditate and spend more time contemplating why it is the noble eightfold path is the means out of suffering.</p>

<p>The first noble truth is that life is inheriently suffering, in life we suffer through things like physical suffering, mental suffering, emotional suffering and it is an inevitability that everyone will suffer in some way in their lives.</p>

<p>The second noble truth is that change is a constant thing in life, and there is no stopping change suffering has a cause and we try to manipulate sitations, people and try to get our way. But the important thing to remember about the second noble truth is that disastification arises within us. Its you that are disasstified with the current position of the fact that you are going to suffer and that no mattar what you do life is inherientely suffering</p>

<p>The third noble truth which is perhaps the hardest one to grasp is that the cause of suffering is desire and attachment to things or disasstification as the Buddha describes it, because for me I realize that I have a lot of wants and also somewhat realize that not everyone can have what they want in life which is a universal truth and I guess I just need to be more accepting of this fact. Then I realize that I take it out on myself somewhat when I can’t have what I want because of my own arrognace.</p>

<p>The fourth noble truth is the promise that you can end your suffering and the suffering of others by teaching the noble four truths through ahering to the noble eightfold path. Which is right understanding, right intentions, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right concentration, right mindfulness. I won’t go into too much detail but this is the means out of suffering. Which I am still putting efforts to recognize.</p>
