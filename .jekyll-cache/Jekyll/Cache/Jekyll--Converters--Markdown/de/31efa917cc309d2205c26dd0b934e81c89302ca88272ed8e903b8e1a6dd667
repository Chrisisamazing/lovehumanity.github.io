I"q<p>There is a stigma around mental health, because we like to think our mental health is all good, but let me just say that in my <a href="https://lovehumanity.gitlab.io/wellbeing/spiritual/Mental-Wellbeing/">mental wellbeing</a> article I said that everyone experiences mental health in their own way. Which is true. Some people hide it better than others though.</p>
