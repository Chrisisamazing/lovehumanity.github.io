I"•<p>In this very short post, I will talk about how to meditate correctly and safely. Note that this is the recommendation from the Great White Brotherhood in their book linking with the 4th dimension linked <a href="https://thegreatwhitebrotherhood.org/books/linking-with-the-4th-dimension/">here</a> at the very last few pages.</p>

<p>Firstly, a room should be selected where you will not have any noise and where you will not have any family members or other distractions from disturbing your meditation. Secondly you should sit on a chair with your back straight, do not lie on a bed. Next sit and just take a moment to allow your metabolism to slow down, then when ready thank God for sending his protection and thank Godâ€™s angels and your guides for standing guard over the meditation keeping away any interference.</p>

<p>Next with your hands describe just outside your body a sort of egg shape or cocoon and imagine that you are within this cocoon of spiritual power. No need to exaggerate this part but it suffices to describe this egg shape with your hands and visualize it around your body. You are now protected in the astral realms by Godâ€™s angels and protected in the etheric by being in this eggshell of protective power.</p>

<p>Next sit quietly for about 15 minutes, doing your best to still the mind and pushing away the thoughts that invade the mind. After you have finished send out love to anyone that might be ill or has problems. Or if you choose you can send out peaceful loving thoughts out to the world. This part is important because when we meditate, we receive Godâ€™s power and should always send that power onwards so that it helps others.</p>

<p>Finally, after this is done remove with your mind this eggshell of protection created. Thank God and his angels for having stood guard over your meditation and then return to normal and carry on with life. Over time meditation will transform your life.</p>
